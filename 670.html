<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 670:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever purposely throws himself from a mountain and kills himself, will be<br/>
in the (Hell) Fire falling down into it and abiding therein perpetually forever; and whoever drinks<br/>
poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the<br/>
(Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever; and whoever kills himself with an iron weapon,<br/>
will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein<br/>
he will abide eternally forever.&quot;<br/>
