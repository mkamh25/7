<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 42:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Habiba:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Do you like to have (my sister) the daughter of Abu Sufyan?&quot; The Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;What shall I do (with her)?&quot; I said, &quot;Marry her.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you like that?&quot; I said, &quot;(Yes), for<br/>
even now I am not your only wife, so I like that my sister should share you with me.&quot; He said, &quot;She is<br/>
not lawful for me (to marry).&quot; I said, &quot;We have heard that you want to marry.&quot; He said, &quot;The daughter<br/>
of Um Salama?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she should be unlawful<br/>
for me to marry, for Thuwaiba suckled me and her father (Abu Salama). So you should neither<br/>
present your daughters, nor your sisters, to me.&quot;<br/>
