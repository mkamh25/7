<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 93:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
that she borrowed a necklace from Asma&#039; and then it got lost. So Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
sent some people from his companions in search of it. In the meantime the stated time for the<br/>
prayer became due and they offered their prayer without ablution. When they came to the Prophet,<br/>
they complained about it to him, so the Verse regarding Tayammum was revealed .<br/>
Usaid bin Hudair said, &quot;(O &#039;Aisha!) may Allah bless you with a good reward, for by Allah, never did<br/>
a difficulty happen in connection with you, but Allah made an escape from it for you, and brought<br/>
Allah&#039;s Blessings for the Muslims.&quot;<br/>
