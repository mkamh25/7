<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 606:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &#039;Nations were displayed before me; one or two prophets would pass by along<br/>
with a few followers. A prophet would pass by accompanied by nobody. Then a big crowd of people<br/>
passed in front of me and I asked, Who are they Are they my followers?&quot; It was said, &#039;No. It is Moses<br/>
and his followers It was said to me, &#039;Look at the horizon.&#039;&#039; Behold! There was a multitude of people<br/>
filling the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#039;Look there and there about the stretching sky! Behold!<br/>
There was a multitude filling the horizon,&#039; It was said to me, &#039;This is your nation out of whom seventy<br/>
thousand shall enter Paradise without reckoning.&#039; &quot;Then the Prophet entered his house without<br/>
telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So the people started talking about the issue and<br/>
said, &quot;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either<br/>
ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period<br/>
of Ignorance.&#039;&#039; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. &quot;Those people are those who<br/>
do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do<br/>
they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &quot; On that<br/>
&#039;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &quot;Am I one of them, O Allah&#039;s Apostle?&#039; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then another<br/>
person got up and said, &quot;Am I one of them?&quot; The Prophet said, &#039;Ukasha has anticipated you.&quot;<br/>
