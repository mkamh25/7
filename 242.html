<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 242:<br/><br/>
Narrated Qasim bin Muhammad and Sulaiman bin Yasar:<br/>
that Yahya bin Said bin Al-&#039;As divorced the daughter of &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Hakarn. Abdur-<br/>
Rahman took her to his house. On that &#039;Aisha sent a message to Marwan bin Al-Hakam who was the<br/>
ruler of Medina, saying, &quot;Fear Allah, and urge your brother) to return her to her house.&quot; Marwan (in<br/>
Sulaiman&#039;s version) said, &quot;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Hakam did not obey me (or had a convincing argument).&quot;<br/>
(In Al-Qasim&#039;s versions Marwan said, &quot;Have you not heard of the case of Fatima bint Qais?&quot;<br/>
Aisha said, &quot;The case of Fatima bint Qais is not in your favor.&#039; Marwan bin Al-Hakam said to &#039;Aisha,<br/>
&quot;The reason that made Fatima bint Qais go to her father&#039;s house is just applicable to the daughter of<br/>
&#039;Abdur-Rahman.&quot;<br/>
