<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 710:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Sa&#039;id Al-Khudri<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle forbade two ways of wearing clothes and two kinds of dealings. (A) He forbade the<br/>
dealings of the Mulamasa and the Munabadha. In the Mulamasa transaction the buyer just touches<br/>
the garment he wants to buy at night or by daytime, and that touch would oblige him to buy it. In the<br/>
Munabadha, one man throws his garment at another and the latter throws his at the former and the<br/>
barter is complete and valid without examining the two objects or being satisfied with them (B) The<br/>
two ways of wearing clothes were Ishtimal-as-Samma, i e., to cover one&#039;s shoulder with one&#039;s garment<br/>
and leave the other bare: and the other way was to wrap oneself with a garment while one was<br/>
sitting In such a way that nothing of that garment would cover one&#039;s private part<br/>
