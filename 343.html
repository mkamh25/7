<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 343:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
I used to accompany Allah&#039;s Apostle to fill my stomach; and that was when I did not eat baked<br/>
bread, nor wear silk. Neither a male nor a female slave used to serve me, and I used to bind stones<br/>
over my belly and ask somebody to recite a Quranic Verse for me though I knew it, so that he might<br/>
take me to his house and feed me. Ja&#039;far bin Abi Talib was very kind to the poor, and he used to take<br/>
us and feed us with what ever was available in his house, (and if nothing was available), he used to<br/>
give us the empty (honey or butter) skin which we would tear and lick whatever was in it.<br/>
