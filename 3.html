<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 3:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Alqama:<br/>
While I was with Abdullah, &#039;Uthman met him at Mina and said, &quot;O Abu &#039;Abdur-Rahman ! I have<br/>
something to say to you.&quot; So both of them went aside and &#039;Uthman said, &quot;O Abu &#039;Abdur-Rah. man!<br/>
Shall we marry you to a virgin who will make you remember your past days?&quot; When &#039;Abdullah felt<br/>
that he was not in need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, &quot;O &#039;Alqama!&quot; Then I heard him<br/>
saying (in reply to &#039;Uthman), &quot;As you have said that, (I tell you that) the Prophet once said to us, &#039;O<br/>
young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and whoever is not able to<br/>
marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.<br/>
