<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 736:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Khalid bint Khalid:<br/>
Some clothes were presented to Allah&#039;s Apostle as a gift and there was a black Khamisa with it. The<br/>
Prophet asked (his companions), &quot;To whom do you suggest we give this Khamisa?&quot; The people kept<br/>
quiet. Then he said, &quot;Bring me Um Khalid,&quot; So I was brought to him and he dressed me with it with<br/>
his own hands and said twice, &quot;May you live so long that you will wear out many garments.&quot; He then<br/>
started looking at the embroidery of that Khamisa and said, &quot;O Um Khalid! This is Sana!&quot; (Sana in<br/>
Ethiopian language means beautiful.) Ishaq, a sub-narrator, said: A woman of my family had told me<br/>
that she had seen the Khamisa worn by Um Khalid.<br/>
