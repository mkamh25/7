<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 591:<br/><br/>
Narrated Khalid bin Sad:<br/>
We went out and Ghalib bin Abjar was accompanying us. He fell ill on the way and when we arrived<br/>
at Medina he was still sick. Ibn Abi &#039;Atiq came to visit him and said to us, &quot;Treat him with black<br/>
cumin. Take five or seven seeds and crush them (mix the powder with oil) and drop the resulting<br/>
mixture into both nostrils, for &#039;Aisha has narrated to me that she heard the Prophet saying, &#039;This<br/>
black cumin is healing for all diseases except As-Sam.&#039; Aisha said, &#039;What is As-Sam?&#039; He said, &#039;Death.&quot;<br/>
