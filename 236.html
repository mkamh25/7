<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 236:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
Those involved in a case of Lian were mentioned before Allah&#039;s Apostle Asim bin Adi said something<br/>
about that and then left. Later on a man from his tribe came to him and told him that he had<br/>
found another man with his wife. On that &#039;Asim said, &quot;I have not been put to task except for what I<br/>
have said (about Lian).&quot; &#039;Asim took the man to Allah&#039;s Apostle and he told him of the state in which he<br/>
found his wife. The man was pale, thin and lank-haired, while the other man whom he had found<br/>
with his wife was brown, fat with thick calves and curly hair. Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;O Allah! Reveal<br/>
the truth.&quot; Then the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he<br/>
had found with her. So Allah&#039;s Apostle ordered them to carry out Lien. A man from that gathering<br/>
said to Ibn &#039;Abbas, &quot;Was she the same lady regarding whom Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &#039;If I were to stone to<br/>
death someone without witnesses, I would have stoned this lady&#039;?&quot; Ibn &#039;Abbas said, &quot;No, that was another<br/>
lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion because of her outright misbehavior.&quot;<br/>
