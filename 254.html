<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 254:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um &#039;Atiyya:<br/>
We were forbidden to mourn for more than three days for a dead person, except for a husband,<br/>
for whom a wife should mourn for four months and ten days (while in the mourning period) we<br/>
were not allowed to put kohl in our eyes, nor perfume our-selves, nor wear dyed clothes, except a<br/>
garment of &#039;Asb (special clothes made in Yemen). But it was permissible for us that when one of us<br/>
became clean from her menses and took a bath, she could use a piece of a certain kind of incense.<br/>
And it was forbidden for us to follow funeral processions.<br/>
