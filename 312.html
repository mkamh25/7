<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 312:<br/><br/>
Narrated Khalid bin Al-Walid:<br/>
&quot;A roasted mastigure was brought to the Prophet who stretched his hand towards it to eat it. But it<br/>
was said to him, &quot;It is a mastigure.&quot; So he withdrew his hand. Khalid asked, &quot;Is it unlawful to eat?&quot; the<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;No, but it is not found in the land of my people and that is why I do not like eating it.&quot;<br/>
So Khalid started eating (it) while Allah&#039;s Apostle was looking at him. An-Nadr said: &#039;Al-Khazira&#039; (is<br/>
prepared) from bran while &#039;Al-Harira&#039; is prepared from milk.<br/>
