<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 24:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#039;idi:<br/>
A woman came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have come to give you myself in<br/>
marriage (without Mahr).&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle looked at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed his<br/>
glance on her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat<br/>
down. A man from his companions got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If you are not in need of her,<br/>
then marry her to me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Have you got anything to offer?&quot; The man said, &quot;No, by Allah,<br/>
O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Go to your family and see if you have something.&quot;<br/>
The man went and returned, saying, &quot;No, by Allah, I have not found anything.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said,<br/>
&quot;(Go again) and look for something, even if it is an iron ring.&quot; He went again and returned, saying,<br/>
&quot;No, by Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&quot;<br/>
He had no rida. He added, &quot;I give half of it to her.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;What will she do with your<br/>
Izar? If you wear it, she will be naked, and if she wears it, you will be naked.&quot; So that man sat down<br/>
for a long while and then got up (to depart). When Allah&#039;s Apostle saw him going, he ordered that he<br/>
be called back. When he came, the Prophet said, &quot;How much of the Quran do you know?&quot; He said, &quot;I<br/>
know such Sura and such Sura,&quot; counting them. The Prophet said, &quot;Do you know them by heart?&quot; He<br/>
replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go, I marry her to you for that much of the Quran which you have.&quot;<br/>
