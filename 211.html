<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 211:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) When believing women came to the Prophet as emigrants, he used to test<br/>
them in accordance with the order of Allah. &#039;O you who believe! When believing women come to<br/>
you as emigrants, examine them . . .&#039; (60.10) So if anyone of those believing women accepted the<br/>
above mentioned conditions, she accepted the conditions of faith. When they agreed on those conditions<br/>
and confessed that with their tongues, Allah&#039;s Apostle would say to them, &quot;Go, I have accepted<br/>
your oath of allegiance (for Islam). By Allah, and hand of Allah&#039;s Apostle never touched the hand of<br/>
any woman, but he only used to take their pledge of allegiance orally. By Allah, Allah&#039;s Apostle did<br/>
not take the pledge of allegiance of the women except in accordance with what Allah had ordered<br/>
him. When he accepted their pledge of allegiance he would say to them, &quot;I have accepted your oath<br/>
of allegiance.&quot;<br/>
