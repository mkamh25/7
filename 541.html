<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 541:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
An Arab lady was mentioned to the Prophet so he asked Abu Usaid As-Sa&#039;idi to send for her, and<br/>
he sent for her and she came and stayed in the castle of Bani Sa&#039;ida. The Prophet came out and went<br/>
to her and entered upon her. Behold, it was a lady sitting with a drooping head. When the Prophet<br/>
spoke to her, she said, &quot;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&quot; He said, &quot;I grant you refuge from me.&quot;<br/>
They said to her, &quot;Do you know who this is?&quot; She said, &quot;No.&quot; They said, &quot;This is Allah&#039;s Apostle who has<br/>
come to command your hand in marriage.&quot; She said, &quot;I am very unlucky to lose this chance.&quot; Then<br/>
the Prophet and his companions went towards the shed of Bani Sa&#039;ida and sat there. Then he said,<br/>
&quot;Give us water, O Sahl!&quot; So I took out this drinking bowl and gave them water in it. The sub-narrator<br/>
added: Sahl took out for us that very drinking bowl and we all drank from it. Later on Umar bin &#039;Abdul<br/>
&#039;Aziz requested Sahl to give it to him as a present, and he gave it to him as a present.<br/>
