<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 648:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
The Prophet once came out to us and said, &quot;Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet<br/>
would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of<br/>
people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I<br/>
wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, &#039;This is Moses and his followers.&#039; Then it<br/>
was said to me, &#039;Look&#039;&#039; I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the<br/>
horizon. It was said, &quot;Look this way and that way.&#039; So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it<br/>
was said to me, &quot;These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise<br/>
without (being asked about their) accounts. &quot; Then the people dispersed and the Prophet did not tell<br/>
who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of<br/>
them said, &quot;As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and<br/>
His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.&quot; That talk reached the Prophet<br/>
who said, &quot;These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get<br/>
treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.&quot;<br/>
then &#039;Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Am I one of those (70,000)?&quot; The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then another person got up and said, &quot;Am I one of them?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;<br/>
&#039;Ukasha has anticipated you.&quot;<br/>
