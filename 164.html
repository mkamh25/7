<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 164:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Once Sada bint Zam&#039;a went out at night for some need, and &#039;Umar saw her, and recognizing her,<br/>
he said (to her), &quot;By Allah, O Sada! You cannot hide yourself from us.&quot; So she returned to the Prophet<br/>
and mentioned that to him while he was sitting in my dwelling taking his supper and holding a bone<br/>
covered with meat in his hand. Then the Divine Inspiration was revealed to him and when that state<br/>
was over, he (the Prophet was saying: &quot;O women! You have been allowed by Allah to go out for your<br/>
needs.&quot;<br/>
