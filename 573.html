<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 573:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
When Allah&#039;s Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among<br/>
whom was &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, &quot;Come, let me write for you a statement after<br/>
which you will not go astray.&quot; &#039;Umar said, &quot;The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#039;an; so<br/>
the Book of Allah is enough for us.&quot; The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some<br/>
said &quot;Go near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray,&quot;<br/>
while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said, &quot;Go away!&quot; Narrated &#039;Ubaidullah: Ibn &#039;Abbas used to say, &quot;It was very unfortunate that<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement<br/>
and noise.&quot;<br/>
