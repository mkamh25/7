<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 445:<br/><br/>
Narrated Khalid bin Al-Walid:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle and I entered the house of Maimuna. A roasted mastigure was served. Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle stretched his hand out (to eat of it) but some woman said, &quot;Inform Allah&#039;s Apostle of what he<br/>
is about to eat.&quot; So they said, &quot;It is mastigure, O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; He withdrew his hand, whereupon I<br/>
said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Is it unlawful?&quot; He said, &quot;No, but this is not found in the land of my people, so<br/>
I dislike it.&quot; So I pulled the mastigure towards me and ate it while Allah&#039;s Apostle was looking at me.<br/>
