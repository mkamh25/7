<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 337:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila:<br/>
We were sitting in the company of Hudhaifa who asked for water and a Magian brought him water.<br/>
But when he placed the cup in his hand, he threw it at him and said, &quot;Had I not forbidden him to<br/>
do so more than once or twice?&quot; He wanted to say, &quot;I would not have done so,&quot; adding, &quot;but I heard<br/>
the Prophet saying, &quot;Do not wear silk or Dibaja, and do not drink in silver or golden vessels, and do<br/>
not eat in plates of such metals, for such things are for the unbelievers in this worldly life and for us<br/>
in the Hereafter.&quot;<br/>
