<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 341:<br/><br/>
Narrated Qasim bin Muhammad:<br/>
Three traditions have been established because of Barira: &#039;Aisha intended to buy her and set her<br/>
free, but Barira&#039;s masters said, &quot;Her wala&#039; will be for us.&quot; &#039;Aisha mentioned that to Allah&#039;s Apostle who<br/>
said, &quot;You could accept their condition if you wished, for the wala is for the one who manumits the<br/>
slave.&quot; Barira was manumitted, then she was given the choice either to stay with her husband or<br/>
leave him; One day Allah&#039;s Apostle entered &#039;Aisha&#039;s house while there was a cooking pot of food boiling<br/>
on the fire. The Prophet asked for lunch, and he was presented with bread and some extra food<br/>
from the home-made Udm (e.g. soup). He asked, &quot;Don&#039;t I see meat (being cooked)?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes, O<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle! But it is the meat that has been given to Barira in charity and she has given it to us as<br/>
a present.&quot; He said, &quot;For Barira it is alms, but for us it is a present.&quot;<br/>
