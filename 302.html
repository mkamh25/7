<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 302:<br/><br/>
Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu&#039;man:<br/>
that while they were with the Prophet at As-Sahba&#039; which was at a distance of one day&#039;s journey<br/>
from Khaibar the prayer became due, and the Prophet asked the people for food but there was nothing<br/>
with the people except Sawiq. He ate of it and we ate along with him, and then he asked for water<br/>
and rinsed his mouth (with it), and then offered the (Maghrib) prayer and we too offered the<br/>
prayer but the Prophet did not perform ablution (again after eating the Sawiq.).<br/>
