<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 371:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Mas&#039;ud Al-Ansari:<br/>
There was an Ansari man nicknamed, Abu Shu&#039;aib, who had a slave who was a butcher. He came<br/>
to the Prophet while he was sitting with his companions and noticed the signs of hunger on the face<br/>
of the Prophet . So he went to his butcher slave and said, &quot;Prepare for me a meal sufficient for five<br/>
persons so that I may invite the Prophet along with four other men.&quot; He had the meal prepared for<br/>
him and invited him. A (sixth) man followed them. The Prophet said, &quot;O Abu Shu&#039;aib! Another man<br/>
has followed us. If you wish, you may invite him; and if you wish, you may refuse him.&quot; Abu Shu&#039;aib<br/>
said, &quot;No, I will admit him.&quot;<br/>
