<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 407:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said that he met Zaid bin &#039;Amr Nufail at a place near Baldah and this had happened<br/>
before Allah&#039;s Apostle received the Divine Inspiration. Allah&#039;s Apostle presented a dish of meat (that<br/>
had been offered to him by the pagans) to Zaid bin &#039;Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said<br/>
(to the pagans), &quot;I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stonealtars (Ansabs) nor do I eat except<br/>
that on which Allah&#039;s Name has been mentioned on slaughtering.&quot;<br/>
