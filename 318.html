<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 318:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Qatada:<br/>
Once, while I was sitting with the companions of the Prophet at a station on the road to Mecca<br/>
and Allah&#039;s Apostle was stationing ahead of us and all the people were assuming Ihram while I was<br/>
not. My companion, saw an onager while I was busy Mending my shoes. They did not Inform me of<br/>
the onager but they wished that I would see it Suddenly I looked and saw the onager Then I headed<br/>
towards my horse, saddled it and rode, but I forgot to take the lash and the spear. So I said to them<br/>
my companions), &quot;Give me the lash and the spear.&quot; But they said, &quot;No, by Allah we will not help you<br/>
in any way to hunt it &#039; I got angry, dismounted, took it the spear and the lash), rode (the horse chased<br/>
the onager and wounded it Then I brought it when it had dyed. My companions started eating of its<br/>
(cooked) meat, but they suspected that it might be unlawful to eat of its meat while they were in a<br/>
state of Ihram Then I proceeded further and I kept one of its forelegs with me. When we met Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle we asked him about that. He said, &quot;Have you some of its meat with you?&quot; I gave him that<br/>
foreleg and he ate the meat till he stripped the bone of its flesh although he was in a state of Ihram.<br/>
