<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 752:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
The Prophet used to construct a loom with a Hasir at night m order to pray therein, and during the<br/>
day he used to spread it out and sit on it. The people started coming to the Prophet at night to offer<br/>
the prayer behind him When their number increased, the Prophet faced them and said. O people! Do<br/>
only those good deeds which you can do, for Allah does not get tired (of giving reward) till you get<br/>
tired, and the best deeds to Allah are the incessant ones though they were few<br/>
