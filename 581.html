<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 581:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
When Allah&#039;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them<br/>
and said, &quot;O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?&quot; Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he<br/>
used to say, &quot;Everybody is staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe<br/>
laces.&quot; And when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): &quot;Would that I could stay<br/>
overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good<br/>
smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and would that Shama<br/>
and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!&quot; I went to Allah&#039;s Apostle and informed<br/>
him about that. He said, &quot;O Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca, and<br/>
make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd, and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.&quot; (See<br/>
Hadith No 558) .<br/>
