<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 451:<br/><br/>
Narrated Rait&#039; bin Khadij:<br/>
I said to the Prophet, &quot;We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (for<br/>
slaughtering)&#039; He said, &quot;If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out,<br/>
and if Allah&#039;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth<br/>
or nail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&quot;<br/>
The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet was behind the people.<br/>
So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned<br/>
upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to<br/>
ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with<br/>
them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &quot;Of these animals<br/>
there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this<br/>
(shoot it with an arrow).&quot;<br/>
