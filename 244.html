Volume 7, Book 63, Number 244:<br/><br/>
Narrated Qasim:<br/>
Ursa said to Aisha, &quot;Do you know so-and-so, the daughter of Al-Hakam? Her husband divorced<br/>
her irrevocably and she left (her husband&#039;s house).&quot; &#039;Aisha said, &quot;What a bad thing she has done!&quot;<br/>
&#039;Ursa said (to &#039;Aisha), &quot;Haven&#039;t you heard the statement of Fatima?&quot; &#039;Aisha replied, &quot;It is not in her fa-<br/>
vor to mention.&quot; &#039;Ursa added, &#039;Aisha reproached (Fatima) severely and said, &quot;Fatima was in a lonely<br/>
place, and she was proned to danger, so the Prophet allowed her (to go out of her husband&#039;s house).&quot;<br/>
