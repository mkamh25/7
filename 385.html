<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Adi bin Hatim:<br/>
I asked Allah&#039;s Apostle about the Mi&#039;rad. He said, &quot;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but<br/>
if the Mi&#039;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been<br/>
beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&quot; I asked, &quot;If I let loose my trained hound after a<br/>
game?&quot; He said, &quot;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then<br/>
you can eat.&quot; I said, &quot;If the hound eats of the game?&quot; He said &quot;Then you should not eat of it, for the<br/>
hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&quot; I said, &quot;Some times I send my hound and then<br/>
I find some other hound with it?&quot; He said &quot;Don&#039;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of<br/>
Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&quot;<br/>
