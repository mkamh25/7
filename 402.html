<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 402:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir:<br/>
The Prophet sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu<br/>
&#039;Ubaida to ambush a caravan of the Quraish. But we were struck with such severe hunger that we<br/>
ate the Khabt (desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabt. Then the sea threw a<br/>
huge fish called Al-&#039;Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till<br/>
our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a<br/>
rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger<br/>
became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu &#039;Ubaida forbade him to do so.<br/>
