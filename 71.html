<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 71:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ursa bin Az-Zubair:<br/>
that he asked &#039;Aisha, saying to her, &quot;O Mother! (In what connection was this Verse revealed):<br/>
&#039;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with orphan girls (to the end of the verse) that<br/>
your right hands possess?&quot; (4.3) Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! It was about the female orphan under<br/>
the protection of her guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry<br/>
her with a little or reduced Mahr. So such guardians were forbidden to marry female orphans unless<br/>
they deal with them justly and give their full Mahr; and they were ordered to marry women other<br/>
than them.&quot;&#039;Aisha added, &quot;(Later) the people asked Allah&#039;s Apostle, for instructions, and then Allah revealed:<br/>
&#039;They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . And yet whom you desire to marry.&#039;<br/>
(4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a female orphan had wealth and beauty, they<br/>
desired to marry her and were interested in her noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if<br/>
she was not desired by them because of her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married<br/>
some other woman. So, as they used to leave her when they had no interest in her, they had no right<br/>
to marry her if they had the desire to do so, unless they deal justly with her and gave her a full<br/>
amount of Mahr.&quot;<br/>
