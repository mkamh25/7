<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 612:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet)<br/>
When the health of Allah&#039;s Apostle deteriorated and his condition became serious, he asked the<br/>
permission of all his wives to allow him to be treated In my house, and they allowed him. He came<br/>
out, supported by two men and his legs were dragging on the ground between Abbas and another<br/>
man. (The sub-narrator told Ibn &#039;Abbas who said: Do you know who was the other man whom &#039;Aisha<br/>
did not mention? The sub-narrator said: No. Ibn Abbas said: It was &#039;Ali.) &#039;Aisha added: When the<br/>
Prophet entered my house and his disease became aggravated, he said, &quot;Pour on me seven water skins<br/>
full of water (the tying ribbons of which had not been untied) so that I may give some advice to the<br/>
people.&quot; So we made him sit in a tub belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and started pouring<br/>
water on him from those water skins till he waved us to stop. Then he went out to the people and led<br/>
them in prayer and delivered a speech before them.<br/>
