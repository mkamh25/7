Volume 7, Book 72, Number 770:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
A necklace belonging to Asma&#039; was lost, and the Prophet sent men in its search. The time for the<br/>
prayer became due and they were without ablution and they could not find water; therefore they<br/>
prayed without ablution, They mentioned that to the Prophet . Then Allah revealed the Verse of<br/>
Tayammum. (&#039;Aisha added: that she had borrowed (the necklace) from Asma&#039;).<br/>
