<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:<br/><br/>
Narrated Adi bin Hatim:<br/>
I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#039;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece<br/>
of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &quot;If the game is killed with its<br/>
sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful<br/>
to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&quot; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound.<br/>
He said, &quot;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its<br/>
slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might<br/>
have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because<br/>
you have mentioned Allah&#039;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned<br/>
it on some other hound<br/>
