<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 401:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir:<br/>
We went out in a campaign and the army was called The Army of the Khabt, and Abu &#039;Ubaida was<br/>
our commander. We were struck with severe hunger. Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called<br/>
Al-&#039;Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu<br/>
&#039;Ubaida took one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.<br/>
