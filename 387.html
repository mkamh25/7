<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Tha&#039;laba Al-Khushani:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take<br/>
our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow<br/>
and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to<br/>
eat?&quot; He said, &quot;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get<br/>
utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their<br/>
utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#039;s Name, eat of<br/>
it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#039;s Name, eat of it, and if<br/>
you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&quot;<br/>
