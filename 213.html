<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 213:<br/><br/>
Narrated Nafi:<br/>
Ibn &#039;Umar used to say about the Ila (which Allah defined (in the Holy Book), &quot;If the period of Ila<br/>
expires, then the husband has either to retain his wife in a handsome manner or to divorce her as<br/>
Allah has ordered.&quot; Ibn &#039;Umar added, &quot;When the period of four months has expired, the husband<br/>
should be put in prison so that he should divorce his wife, but the divorce does not occur unless the<br/>
husband himself declares it. This has been mentioned by &#039;Uthman, &#039;Ali, Abu Ad-Darda, &#039;Aisha and<br/>
twelve other companions of the Prophet .&quot;<br/>
