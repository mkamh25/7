<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 427:<br/><br/>
Narrated Zahdam:<br/>
We were in the company of Abu Musa Al-Ash&#039;ari and there were friendly relations between us<br/>
and this tribe of Jarm. Abu Musa was presented with a dish containing chicken. Among the people<br/>
there was sitting a red-faced man who did not come near the food. Abu Musa said (to him), &quot;Come<br/>
on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#039;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&quot; He said, &quot;I have seen it eating<br/>
something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#039; Abu<br/>
Musa said, &quot;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group<br/>
of Al-Ash&#039;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for<br/>
mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#039;I have nothing to<br/>
mount you on&#039; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#039;s Apostle and he asked<br/>
twice, &#039;Where are Al-Ash&#039;ariyin?&quot; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a<br/>
short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &quot;Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#039;s Apostle of his oath, we will never<br/>
be successful.&quot; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts,<br/>
but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your<br/>
oath.&#039; He said, &#039;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath<br/>
and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#039; &quot;<br/>
