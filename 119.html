<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 119:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas :<br/>
I had been eager to ask &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from among the wives of the<br/>
Prophet regarding whom Allah said &#039;If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn<br/>
in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4)<br/>
till &#039;Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &#039;Umar<br/>
went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full<br/>
of water, and when &#039;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands<br/>
and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &quot;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies<br/>
from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &#039;If you two (wives of the Prophet)<br/>
turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?&quot;<br/>
(66.4) He said, &quot;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &#039;Aisha and Hafsa.&quot; Then<br/>
&#039;Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, &quot;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya<br/>
bin Zaid who used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one<br/>
day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding<br/>
the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me.<br/>
We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the<br/>
Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started<br/>
learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked<br/>
that she should answer me back. She said to me, &#039;Why are you so surprised at my answering<br/>
you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not<br/>
speak to) him throughout the day till the night.&#039; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &#039;Whoever has<br/>
done so will be ruined!&#039; Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to<br/>
her, &#039;Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?&#039; She said, &#039;Yes.&#039; I said, &#039;You are a ruined<br/>
losing person! Don&#039;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#039;s Apostle and thus you<br/>
will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up<br/>
talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e.,<br/>
&#039;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet .&quot; Umar<br/>
added,&quot;At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their<br/>
horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to<br/>
us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came<br/>
out to him. He said, &#039;Today a great thing has happened.&#039; I asked, &#039;What is it? Have (the people of)<br/>
Ghassan come?&#039; He said, &#039;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle; has divorced his wives. &#039;Umar added, &quot;The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said<br/>
&quot;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&#039; I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the<br/>
near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and then the<br/>
Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her<br/>
weeping. I asked, &#039;What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce<br/>
you all?&#039; She said, &#039;I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&#039; I came out and sat<br/>
near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat<br/>
with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the<br/>
Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, &#039;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for &#039;Umar<br/>
(to enter)?&#039; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying, &#039;I have spoken<br/>
to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&#039; Then I returned and sat with the group of<br/>
people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave,<br/>
&#039;Will you get the permission for &#039;Umar?&#039; He went in and returned saying, &#039;I mentioned you to him but<br/>
he kept quiet.&#039; So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could<br/>
not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &#039;Will you get the permission for &#039;Umar?&#039; He<br/>
went in and returned to me saying, &#039;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#039; When I was leaving,<br/>
behold! The slave called me, saying, &#039;The Prophet has given you permission.&#039; Then I entered upon Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding<br/>
between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow<br/>
stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Have<br/>
you divorced your wives?&#039; He looked at me and said, &#039;No.&#039; I said, &#039;Allah Akbar!&#039; And then, while still<br/>
standing, I said chatting, &#039;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&#039;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish<br/>
used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here)<br/>
were overpowered by their women.&#039; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &#039;Will you heed what I<br/>
say, O Allah&#039;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &quot;Do not be tempted to imitate your companion<br/>
(&#039;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#039; &quot; The Prophet<br/>
smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and<br/>
by Allah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made<br/>
prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Allah.&#039;<br/>
Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &#039;Are you of such an opinion, O the<br/>
son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this<br/>
world.&#039; I said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.&#039; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives<br/>
for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to &#039;Aisha. The Prophet had said,<br/>
&#039;I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,&#039; because of his anger towards them, when Allah<br/>
had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon<br/>
&#039;Aisha. &#039;Aisha said to him, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for<br/>
one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one.&#039;<br/>
The Prophet said, &#039;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&#039; &#039;Aisha added, &#039;Then Allah revealed the<br/>
Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him.&#039; Then he gave<br/>
option to his other wives and they said what &#039;Aisha had said . &quot; (1) The Prophet, &#039; had decided to abstain<br/>
from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so.<br/>
Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one<br/>
month. See Quran: (66.4)<br/>
