Volume 7, Book 63, Number 181:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Awza:<br/>
I asked Az-Zuhri, &quot;Which of the wives of the Prophet sought refuge with Allah from him?&quot; He said<br/>
&quot;I was told by &#039;Ursa that &#039;Aisha said, &#039;When the daughter of Al-Jaun was brought to Allah&#039;s Apostle (as<br/>
his bride) and he went near her, she said, &quot;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&quot; He said, &quot;You have<br/>
sought refuge with The Great; return to your family.&quot;<br/>
