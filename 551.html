<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 551:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
I visited Allah&#039;s Apostle while he was suffering from a high fever. I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! You<br/>
have a high fever.&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, I have as much fever as two men of you.&quot; I said, &quot;Is it because you<br/>
will have a double reward?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, it is so. No Muslim is afflicted with any harm, even if it<br/>
were the prick of a thorn, but that Allah expiates his sins because of that, as a tree sheds its leaves.&quot;<br/>
