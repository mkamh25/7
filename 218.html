<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 218:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin Abi A&#039;ufa:<br/>
We were with Allah&#039;s Apostle on a journey, and when the sun set, he said to a man, &quot;Get down and<br/>
prepare a drink of Sawiq for me.&quot; The man said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Will you wait till it is evening?&quot;<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle again said, &quot;Get down and prepare a drink of Sawiq.&quot; The man said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle!<br/>
Will you wait till it is evening, for it is still daytime. &quot; The Prophet again said, &quot;Get down and prepare<br/>
a drink of Sawiq.&quot; So the third time the man got down and prepared a drink of sawiq for him. Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle drank thereof and pointed with his hand towards the East, saying, &quot;When you see the night<br/>
falling from this side, then a fasting person should break his fast.&quot;<br/>
Volume 7, Book 63, Number 219a:<br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin Mas&#039;ud:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;The call (or the Adhan) of Bila should not stop you from taking the Suhur-meals<br/>
for Bilal calls (or pronounces the Adhan) so that the one who is offering the night prayer should take<br/>
a rest, and he does not indicate the daybreak or dawn.&quot; The narrator, Yazid, described (how dawn<br/>
breaks) by stretching out his hands and then separating them wide apart.<br/>
Volume 7, Book 63, Number 219i:<br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said, The example of a miser and a generous person is like that of two persons<br/>
wearing iron cloaks from the breast upto the neck When the generous person spends, the iron cloak<br/>
enlarges and spread over his skin so much so that it covers his fingertips and obliterates his tracks.<br/>
As for the miser, as soon as he thinks of spending every ring of the iron cloak sticks to its place<br/>
(against his body) and he tries to expand it, but it does not expand. The Prophet pointed with his<br/>
hand towards his throat.<br/>
