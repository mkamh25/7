<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 287:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
The family of Muhammad did not eat their fill for three successive days till he died.<br/>
Volume 7, Book 65, Number 287i:<br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe hunger), I met &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I<br/>
asked him to recite a verse from Allah&#039;s Book to me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me.<br/>
(Then I went out and) after walking for a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and<br/>
severe hunger. Suddenly I saw Allah&#039;s Apostle standing by my head. He said, &quot;O Abu Huraira!&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&#039;s Apostle, and Sadaik!&quot; Then he held me by the hand, and made me get up.<br/>
Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and ordered a big bowl<br/>
of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, &quot;Drink more, O Abu Hirr!&quot; So I drank again, whereupon<br/>
he again said, &quot;Drink more.&quot; So I drank more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards<br/>
I met &#039;Umar and mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, &quot;Somebody,<br/>
who had more right than you, O &#039;Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to<br/>
me while I knew it better than you.&quot; On that Umar said to me, &quot;By Allah, if I admitted and entertained<br/>
you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.<br/>
