<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 14:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha :<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Suppose you landed in a valley where there is a tree of which something<br/>
has been eaten and then you found trees of which nothing has been eaten, of which tree would you<br/>
let your camel graze?&quot; He said, &quot;(I will let my camel graze) of the one of which nothing has been<br/>
eaten before.&quot; (The sub-narrator added: &#039;Aisha meant that Allah&#039;s Apostle had not married a virgin<br/>
besides herself .)<br/>
