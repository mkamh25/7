<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 479:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu &#039;Ubaid:<br/>
(in continuation of 478). Then I witnessed the &#039;Id with &#039;Uthman bin &#039;Affan, and that was on a Friday.<br/>
He offered the prayer before the sermon, saying, &quot;O people! Today you have two &#039;Its (festivals)<br/>
together, so whoever of those who live at Al-&#039;Awali (suburbs) would like to wait for the Jumua prayer,<br/>
he may wait, and whoever would like to return (home) Is granted my permission to do so.&quot; Then I<br/>
witnessed (the &#039;Its) with &#039;Ali bin Abi Talib, and he too offered the &#039;Id prayer before the sermon and<br/>
then delivered the sermon before the people and said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle has forbidden you to eat the<br/>
meat of your sacrifices for more than three days.&quot;<br/>
