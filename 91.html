<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 91:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Did you get Anmat?&quot; I said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! From where can we have Anmat?&quot;<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Soon you will have them Anmat)<br/>
Volume 7, Book 62, Number 92p:<br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
that she prepared a lady for a man from the Ansar as his bride and the Prophet said, &quot;O &#039;Aisha!<br/>
Haven&#039;t you got any amusement (during the marriage ceremony) as the Ansar like amusement?&quot;<br/>
Volume 7, Book 62, Number 92m:<br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
&quot;Whenever the Prophet passed by (my mother Um-Sulaim) he used to enter her and greet her.<br/>
Anas further said: Once the Prophet way a bridegroom during his marriage with Zainab, Um Sulaim<br/>
said to me, &quot;Let us give a gift to Allah&#039;s Apostle .&quot; I said to her, &quot;Do it.&quot; So she prepared Haisa (a sweet<br/>
dish) made from dates, butter and dried yoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him and<br/>
he said, &quot;Put it down,&quot; and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and to invite whomever I<br/>
would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I found the house crowded with<br/>
people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa and saying over it whatever Allah<br/>
wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, &quot;Mention<br/>
the Name of Allah, and each man should eat of the dish the nearest to him.&quot; When all of them<br/>
had finished their meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy.<br/>
Then the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after<br/>
him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling place and let<br/>
the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting the Verses:-- &#039;O you who<br/>
believe! Enter not the Prophet&#039;s house until leave is given you for a meal, (and then) not (as early as)<br/>
to what for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals,<br/>
disperse without sitting for a talk. Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of<br/>
(asking) you (to go), but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.&#039; (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas<br/>
said, &quot;I served the Prophet for ten years.&quot;<br/>
