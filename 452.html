<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 452:<br/><br/>
Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:<br/>
While we were with the Prophet. on a journey, one of the camels ran away. A man shot it with an<br/>
arrow and stopped it. The Prophet said, &quot;Of these camels some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of<br/>
them runs away and you cannot catch it, then do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we<br/>
have no knives.&quot; He said, &quot;Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to<br/>
flow out, and if Allah&#039;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering<br/>
instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&quot;<br/>
Book 68: Al-Adha Festival Sacrifice (Adaahi)<br/>
