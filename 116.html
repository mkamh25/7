<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 116:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Umar:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Everyone of you is a guardian and everyone of you is responsible (for his<br/>
wards). A ruler is a guardian and is responsible(for his subjects); a man is a guardian of his family<br/>
and responsible (for them); a wife is a guardian of her husband&#039;s house and she is responsible (for it),<br/>
a slave is a guardian of his master&#039;s property and is responsible (for that). Beware! All of you are<br/>
guardians and are responsible (for your wards).&quot;<br/>
