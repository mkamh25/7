<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Adi bin Hatim:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#039;s Name on sending<br/>
it.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#039;s Name on<br/>
sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it<br/>
has killed it for itself.&quot; I said, &quot;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound<br/>
along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&quot; He said, &quot;You must not eat of it<br/>
because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did<br/>
not mention it on the other hound.&quot; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#039;rad (i.e. a<br/>
sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting).<br/>
He said, &quot;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side<br/>
(shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie<br/>
