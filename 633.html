<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 633:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
Some of the companions of the Prophet passed by some people staying at a place where there was<br/>
water, and one of those people had been stung by a scorpion. A man from those staying near the water,<br/>
came and said to the companions of the Prophet, &quot;Is there anyone among you who can do Ruqya<br/>
as near the water there is a person who has been stung by a scorpion.&quot; So one of the Prophet&#039;s com-<br/>
panions went to him and recited Surat-al-Fatiha for a sheep as his fees. The patient got cured and<br/>
the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, &quot;You have taken wages for<br/>
reciting Allah&#039;s Book.&quot; When they arrived at Medina, they said, &#039; O Allah&#039;s Apostle! (This person) has<br/>
taken wages for reciting Allah&#039;s Book&quot; On that Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;You are most entitled to take<br/>
wages for doing a Ruqya with Allah&#039;s Book.&quot;<br/>
