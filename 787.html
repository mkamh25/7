<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 787:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
The Prophet was neither conspicuously tall, nor short; neither, very white, nor tawny. His hair was<br/>
neither much curled, nor very straight. Allah sent him (as an Apostle) at the age of forty (and after<br/>
that) he stayed for ten years in Mecca, and for ten more years in Medina. Allah took him unto Him at<br/>
the age of sixty, and he scarcely had ten white hairs on his head and in his beard.<br/>
