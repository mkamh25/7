<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 765:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abdullah:<br/>
The Prophet had a golden ring made for himself, and when he wore it. he used to turn its stone toward<br/>
the palm of his! hand. So the people too had gold made for themselves. The Prophet then ascended<br/>
the pulpit, and after glorifying and praising Allah, he said, &quot;I had it made for me, but now I<br/>
will never wear it again.&quot; He threw it away, and then the people threw away their rings too. (Juwairiya,<br/>
a sub-narrator, said: I think Anas said that the Prophet was wearing the ring in his right hand.)<br/>
