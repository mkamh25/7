<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 256:<br/><br/>
Narrated Mujahid:<br/>
(regarding the Verse): &#039;If any of you dies and leaves wives behind,&#039; That was the period of the &#039;Iddah<br/>
which the widow was obliged to spend in the house of the late husband. Then Allah revealed:<br/>
And those of you who die and leave wives should bequeath for their wives a year&#039;s maintenance and<br/>
residence without turning them out, but if they leave, there is no blame on you for what they do of<br/>
themselves, provided it is honorable (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240) Mujahid said: Allah has ordered<br/>
that a widow has the right to stay for seven months and twenty days with her husband&#039;s relatives<br/>
through her husband&#039;s will and testament so that she will complete the period of one year (of &#039;Iddah).<br/>
But the widow has the right to stay that extra period or go out of her husband&#039;s house as is indicated<br/>
by the statement of Allah: &#039;But if they leave there is no blame on you,... &#039; (2.240) Ibn &#039;Abbas said: The<br/>
above Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the &#039;Iddah at her late husband&#039;s house,<br/>
and so she could spend her period of the &#039;Iddah wherever she likes. And Allah says: &#039;Without turning<br/>
them out.&#039; &#039;Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the &#039;Iddah at her husband&#039;s house,<br/>
and live there according to her (husband&#039;s) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of<br/>
her husband&#039;s house) as Allah says: &#039;There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.&#039;<br/>
(2.240) &#039;Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the<br/>
widow) was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the &#039;Iddah wherever she would like, and<br/>
she was no longer entitled to be accommodated by her husband&#039;s family.<br/>
