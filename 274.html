<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 274:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ali:<br/>
Fatima went to the Prophet complaining about the bad effect of the stone hand-mill on her hand.<br/>
She heard that the Prophet had received a few slave girls. But (when she came there) she did not find<br/>
him, so she mentioned her problem to &#039;Aisha. When the Prophet came, &#039;Aisha informed him about<br/>
that. &#039;Ali added, &quot;So the Prophet came to us when we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his<br/>
arrival) but he said, &#039;Stay where you are.&quot; Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the<br/>
coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, &quot;Shall I direct you to something better than what you<br/>
have requested? When you go to bed say &#039;Subhan Allah&#039; thirty-three times, &#039;Alhamdulillah&#039; thirty<br/>
three times, and Allahu Akbar&#039; thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant.&quot;<br/>
