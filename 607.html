<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 607:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Salama:<br/>
The husband of a lady died and her eyes became sore and the people mentioned her story to the<br/>
Prophet They asked him whether it was permissible for her to use kohl as her eyes were exposed to<br/>
danger. He said, &quot;Previously, when one of you was bereaved by a husband she would stay in her dirty<br/>
clothes in a bad unhealthy house (for one year), and when a dog passed by, she would throw a globe<br/>
of dung. No, (she should observe the prescribed period Idda) for four months and ten days.&#039;<br/>
