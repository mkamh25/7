<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 815:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
Allah has cursed those women who practise tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and<br/>
those who remove their face hairs, and those who create a space between their teeth artificially to<br/>
look beautiful, and such women as change the features created by Allah. Why then should I not<br/>
curse those whom the Prophet has cursed? And that is in Allah&#039;s Book. i.e. His Saying: &#039;And what the<br/>
Apostle gives you take it and what he forbids you abstain (from it).&#039; (59.7)<br/>
