<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 261:<br/><br/>
Narrated Said bin Jubair:<br/>
I said to Ibn &#039;Umar, &quot;If a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse (what is the judgment)?&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Prophet separated the couple of Bani &#039;Ajlan (when the husband accused his wife for<br/>
an illegal sexual intercourse). The Prophet said, &#039;Allah knows that one of you two IS a liar; so will one<br/>
of you repent?&#039; But they refused. He then again said, &#039;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will<br/>
one of you repent?&#039; But they refused, whereupon he separated them by divorce.&quot; Aiyub (a sub-narrator)<br/>
said: &#039;Amr bin Dinar said to me, &quot;In the narration there is something which I do not see you<br/>
mentioning, i.e. the husband said, &quot;What about my money (Mahr)?&#039; The Prophet said, &quot;You are not<br/>
entitled to take back money, for if you told the truth you have already entered upon her (and consummated<br/>
your marriage with her) and if you are a liar then you are less entitled to take it back.<br/>
