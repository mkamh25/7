<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 271:<br/><br/>
Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:<br/>
Once I set out to visit &#039;Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper,<br/>
Yarfa, came and said, &quot;Uthman AbdurRahman (bin &#039;Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are<br/>
seeking permission (to meet you).&quot; &#039;Umar said, &quot;Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted,<br/>
and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to &#039;Umar &#039;Shall I admit &#039;Ali and &#039;Abbas?&quot;<br/>
&#039;Umar said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. &#039;Abbas said,<br/>
&quot;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (&#039;Ali).&quot; The group, &#039;Uthman and his companions<br/>
Sad, &#039;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&quot; &#039;Umar said. Wait!<br/>
I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you<br/>
know that Allah&#039;s Apostle said. &#039;We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever<br/>
we leave is to be given in charity.&#039; And by that Allah&#039;s Apostles meant himself?&quot; The group said, &quot;He<br/>
did say so.&quot; &#039;Umar then turned towards &#039;All and &#039;Abbas and said. &quot;I beseech you both by Allah, do you<br/>
know that Allah&#039;s Apostle said that?&quot; They said, &#039;Yes &quot; &#039;Umar said, &quot;Now, let me talk to you about this<br/>
matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give<br/>
to anybody else. And Allah said:-- &#039;And what Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from<br/>
them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do all<br/>
things.&#039; (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah&#039;s Apostle. But by Allah he neither<br/>
withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you<br/>
and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where<br/>
Allah&#039;s Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah&#039;s Apostle kept on acting like this<br/>
throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then &#039;Umar<br/>
said to &#039;Ali and &#039;Abbas, &quot;I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &#039;Umar added,<br/>
&quot;When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, &#039;I am the successor of Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah&#039;s Apostle used to do,<br/>
and both of you knew all about it then.&quot; Then &#039;Umar turned towards &#039;Ali and Abbas and said, &quot;You<br/>
both claim that Abu- Bakr was so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and<br/>
right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, &#039;I am the successor of Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#039; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and<br/>
I used to do the same with it as Allah&#039;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (&#039;Ali and<br/>
&#039;Abbas) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O &#039;Abbas!) You came to me demanding<br/>
your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&#039;Ali) came to me demanding<br/>
his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &#039;If you wish I will<br/>
hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will<br/>
manage it in the same way as Allah&#039;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning<br/>
of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&#039; So you both said, &#039;Hand over this<br/>
property to us on this condition.&#039; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah,<br/>
did I hand it over to them on that condition?&quot; The group said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &#039;Umar then faced &#039;Ali and<br/>
&#039;Abbas and said, &quot;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&quot; They<br/>
both said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &#039;Umar added, &quot;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with<br/>
Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision<br/>
other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then<br/>
return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &quot;<br/>
