<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 732:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:<br/>
&#039;Umar saw a silk suit being sold, so he said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Why don&#039;t you buy it so that you<br/>
may wear it when delegates come to you, and also on Fridays?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;This is worn only<br/>
by him who has no share in the Hereafter.&quot; Afterwards the Prophet sent to &#039;Umar a silk suit suitable<br/>
for wearing. &#039;Umar said to the Prophet, &quot;You have given it to me to wear, yet I have heard you saying<br/>
about it what you said?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;I sent it to you so that you might either sell it or give it to<br/>
somebody else to wear.&quot;<br/>
