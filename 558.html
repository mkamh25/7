<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 558:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
When Allah&#039;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them<br/>
and asked, &quot;O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?&quot; Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr,<br/>
he would recite the following poetic verses: &#039;Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death is<br/>
nearer to him than his shoe laces.&quot; And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic<br/>
lines): &#039;Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir<br/>
and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of the water of<br/>
Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me.&#039; Then I<br/>
came and informed Allah&#039;s Apostle about that, whereupon he said, &quot;O Allah! Make us love Medina as<br/>
much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and<br/>
take away its fever and put it in Al&#039;Juhfa.&quot;<br/>
