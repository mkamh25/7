<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 169:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
(The Prophet) Solomon son of (the Prophet) David said, &quot;Tonight I will go round (i.e. have sexual<br/>
relations with) one hundred women (my wives) everyone of whom will deliver a male child who will<br/>
fight in Allah&#039;s Cause.&quot; On that an Angel said to him, &quot;Say: &#039;If Allah will.&#039; &quot; But Solomon did not say it<br/>
and forgot to say it. Then he had sexual relations with them but none of them delivered any child except<br/>
one who delivered a half person. The Prophet said, &quot;If Solomon had said: &#039;If Allah will,&#039; Allah<br/>
would have fulfilled his (above) desire and that saying would have made him more hopeful.&quot;<br/>
