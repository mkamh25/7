<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Tha&#039;laba Al-Khushani:<br/>
I came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the<br/>
Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my<br/>
bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&quot; He said, &quot;As for<br/>
your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their<br/>
utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find<br/>
(other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the<br/>
land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#039;s Name while hunting,<br/>
then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have<br/>
mentioned Allah&#039;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt<br/>
something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat<br/>
of it.&quot;<br/>
