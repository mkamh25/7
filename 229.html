<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 229:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn Juraij:<br/>
Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl<br/>
bin Sad, the brother of Bani Sa&#039;idi He said, &quot;An Ansari man came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?&#039; So Allah<br/>
revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Quran about the affair of those involved<br/>
in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, &#039;Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.&#039;<br/>
So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man<br/>
said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her.<br/>
Then he divorced her thrice before Allah&#039;s Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian<br/>
process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet .&quot; Ibn Shihab added, &quot;After their case, it became a<br/>
tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant<br/>
then, and later on her son was called by his mother&#039;s name. The tradition concerning their inheritance<br/>
was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had<br/>
prescribed for him.&quot; Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As&#039;Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above<br/>
narration), &quot;If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and<br/>
the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has<br/>
spoken the truth.&quot; Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).<br/>
