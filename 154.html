<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 154:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
While we were sitting with Allah&#039;s Apostle, (he) Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;While I was sleeping, I saw a<br/>
woman performing ablution beside a palace. I asked, &quot;Whose palace is this?&#039; It was said, &#039;This palace<br/>
belongs to &#039;Umar.&#039; Then I remembered his sense of Ghira and returned.&quot; On that &#039;Umar started weeping<br/>
in that gathering and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! How dare I think of my self-respect being offended<br/>
by you?&quot;<br/>
