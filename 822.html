<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 822:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Alqama:<br/>
&#039;Abdullah cursed those women who practiced tattooing and those who removed hair from their<br/>
faces and those who created spaces between their teeth artificially to look beautiful, such ladies as<br/>
changed what Allah has created. Um Ya&#039;qub said, &quot;What is that?&quot; &#039;Abdullah said, &quot;Why should I not<br/>
curse those who were cursed by Allah&#039;s Apostle and are referred to in Allah&#039;s Book?&quot; She said to him<br/>
&quot;By Allah, I have read the whole Qur&#039;an but I have not found such a thing. &#039;Abdullah said, &quot;By Allah,<br/>
if you had read it (carefully) you would have found it. (Allah says:) &#039;And what the Apostle gives you<br/>
take it and what he forbids you abstain (from it).&#039; (59.7)<br/>
