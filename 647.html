<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 647:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
The Prophet, during his fatal ailment used to blow (on his hands and pass them) over his body<br/>
while reciting the Mu&#039;auwidhat (Surat-an-Nas and Surat-al-Falaq). When his disease got aggravated,<br/>
I used to recite them for him and blow (on his hands) and let him pass his hands over his body<br/>
because of its blessing. (Ma&#039;mar asked Ibn Shihab: How did he use to do Nafth? He said: He used to<br/>
blow on his hands and then pass them over his face.)<br/>
