<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 795:<br/><br/>
Narrated Mujahid:<br/>
We were with Ibn &#039;Abbas and the people mentioned Ad-Dajjal. Someone said, &quot;The word &#039;Kafir&#039;<br/>
(unbeliever) is written in between his (Ad-Dajjal&#039;s) eyes.&quot; Ibn &#039;Abbas said, &quot;I have not heard the<br/>
Prophet saying this, but he said, &#039;As regards Abraham, he looks like your companion (i.e. the Prophet,<br/>
Muhammad), and as regards Moses, he is a brown curly haired man riding a camel and reigned<br/>
with a strong jute rope, as if lam now looking at him getting down in the valley and saying,<br/>
&quot;Labbaik&quot;.&#039;&quot;<br/>
