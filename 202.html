<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 202:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) Three traditions were established concerning situations in which Barra<br/>
was involved: When she was manumitted, she was given the option to keep her husband or leave<br/>
him; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;The wala is for the one who manumits, Once Allah&#039;s Apostle entered the<br/>
house while some meat was being cooked in a pot, but only bread and some soup of the house were<br/>
placed before, him. He said, &quot;Don&#039;t I see the pot containing meat?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes, but that meat was<br/>
given to Barira in charity (by someone), and you do not eat what it given in charity.&quot;The Prophet said<br/>
&quot;That meat is alms for her, but for us it is a present.&quot;<br/>
