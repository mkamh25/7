<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 230:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:<br/>
Ibn &#039;Abbas; said, &quot;Once Lian was mentioned before the Prophet whereupon &#039;Asim bin Adi said<br/>
something and went away. Then a man from his tribe came to him, complaining that he had found a<br/>
man width his wife. &#039;Asim said, &#039;I have not been put to task except for my statement (about Lian).&#039;<br/>
&#039;Asim took the man to the Prophet and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife.<br/>
The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with<br/>
his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, &#039;O Allah! Reveal<br/>
the truth.&#039; So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned<br/>
he had found her with. The Prophet then made them carry out Lian.&quot; Then a man from that gathering<br/>
asked Ibn &#039;Abbas, &quot;Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, &#039;If I were to<br/>
stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady&#039;?&quot; Ibn &#039;Abbas said, &quot;No, that<br/>
was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior.<br/>
