<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 632:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:<br/>
Some of the companions of the Prophet came across a tribe amongst the tribes of the Arabs, and<br/>
that tribe did not entertain them. While they were in that state, the chief of that tribe was bitten by a<br/>
snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said, (to the companions of the Prophet ), &quot;Have you got any<br/>
medicine with you or anybody who can treat with Ruqya?&quot; The Prophet&#039;s companions said, &quot;You refuse<br/>
to entertain us, so we will not treat (your chief) unless you pay us for it.&quot; So they agreed to pay<br/>
them a flock of sheep. One of them (the Prophet&#039;s companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and<br/>
gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his people presented<br/>
the sheep to them, but they said, &quot;We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&quot;<br/>
When they asked him, he smiled and said, &quot;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? Take<br/>
it (flock of sheep) and assign a share for me.&quot;<br/>
