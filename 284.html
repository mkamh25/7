<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 284:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
A dead man in debt used to be brought to Allah&#039;s Apostle who would ask, &quot;Has he left anything to<br/>
re pay his debts?&quot; If he was informed that he had left something to cover his debts the Prophet would<br/>
offer the funeral prayer for him; otherwise he would say to the Muslims present there), &quot;Offer the<br/>
funeral prayer for your friend:&quot;but when Allah helped the Prophet to gain victory (on his expeditions),<br/>
he said, &quot;I am closer to the Believers than themselves, so. if one of the Believers dies in debt, I<br/>
will repay it, but if he leaves wealth, it will be for his heirs.<br/>
