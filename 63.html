<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 63:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
While we were sitting in the company of the Prophet a woman came to him and presented herself<br/>
(for marriage) to him. The Prophet looked at her, lowering his eyes and raising them, but did not give<br/>
a reply. One of his companions said, &quot;Marry her to me O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet asked (him),<br/>
&quot;Have you got anything?&quot; He said, &quot;I have got nothing.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Not even an iron ring?&quot; He<br/>
Sad, &quot;Not even an iron ring, but I will tear my garment into two halves and give her one half and<br/>
keep the other half.&quot; The Prophet; said, &quot;No. Do you know some of the Quran (by heart)?&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go, I have agreed to marry her to you with what you know of the Qur&#039;an (as<br/>
her Mahr).&quot; &#039;And for those who have no courses (i.e. they are still immature). (65.4) And the &#039;Iddat<br/>
for the girl before puberty is three months (in the above Verse).<br/>
