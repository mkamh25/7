<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 688:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abdullah bin &#039;Umar:<br/>
When Abdullah bin Ubdi (bin Salul) died, his son came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said &#039; O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle, give me your shirt so that I may shroud my fathers body in it. And please offer a funeral<br/>
prayer for him and invoke Allah for his forgiveness.&quot; The Prophet gave him his shirt and said to him<br/>
&#039;Inform us when you finish (and the funeral procession is ready) call us. When he had finished he<br/>
told the Prophet and the Prophet proceeded to order his funeral prayers but Umar stopped him and<br/>
said, &quot;Didn&#039;t Allah forbid you to offer the funeral prayer for the hypocrites when He said: &quot;Whether<br/>
you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them: (and even) if you ask<br/>
forgiveness for them seventy times. Allah will not forgive them.&quot; (9.80) Then there was revealed:<br/>
&quot;And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave.&quot; (9.34) Thenceforth<br/>
the Prophet did not offer funeral prayers for the hypocrites.<br/>
