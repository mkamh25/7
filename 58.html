<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 58:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
A woman came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have come to you to present myself<br/>
to you (for marriage).&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle glanced at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed his glance<br/>
on her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat down. A<br/>
man from his companions got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If you are not in need of her, then<br/>
marry her to me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Have you got anything to offer.&quot; The man said, &#039;No, by Allah, O<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Go to your family and try to find something.&quot; So the man<br/>
went and returned, saying, &quot;No, by Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have not found anything.&quot; The Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;Go again and look for something, even if it were an iron ring.&quot; He went and returned, saying,<br/>
&quot;No, by Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&#039;<br/>
He had no Rida (upper garment). He added, &quot;I give half of it to her.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said &quot;What will<br/>
she do with your Izar? If you wear it, she will have nothing over herself thereof (will be naked); and<br/>
if she wears it, then you will have nothing over yourself thereof &#039; So the man sat for a long period<br/>
and then got up (to leave). When Allah&#039;s Apostle saw him leaving, he ordered that he e called back.<br/>
When he came, the Prophet asked (him), &quot;How much of the Qur&#039;an do you know (by heart)?&quot; The<br/>
man replied, I know such Sura and such Sura and such Sura,&quot; naming the suras. The Prophet said,<br/>
&quot;Can you recite it by heart?&quot; He said, &#039;Yes.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go I let you marry her for what you<br/>
know of the Quran (as her Mahr).<br/>
