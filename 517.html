<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 517:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle and one of his companions entered upon an Ansari man and the Prophet said to<br/>
him, &quot;If you have water kept overnight in a water skin, (give us), otherwise we will drink water by<br/>
putting our mouth in it.&quot; The man was watering his garden then. He said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have<br/>
water kept overnight; let us go to the shade.&quot; So he took them both there and poured water into a<br/>
bowl and milked a domestic goat of his in it. Allah&#039;s Apostle drank, and then the man who had come<br/>
along with him, drank.<br/>
