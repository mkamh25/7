<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 698:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Some Muslim men emigrated to Ethiopia whereupon Abu Bakr also prepared himself for the<br/>
emigration, but the Prophet said (to him), &quot;Wait, for I hope that Allah will allow me also to emigrate.&quot;<br/>
Abu Bakr said, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. Do you hope that (emigration)?&quot; The<br/>
Prophet said, &#039;Yes.&quot; So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on<br/>
the leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at<br/>
midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, &quot;Here is Allah&#039;s Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his<br/>
face covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Let my<br/>
father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must have brought you here<br/>
at this hour.&quot; The Prophet came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The Prophet<br/>
entered and said to Abu Bakr, &quot;Let those who are with you, go out.&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;(There is no<br/>
stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot; I shall accompany you, O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for you!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes,&quot; Abu Bakr said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostles! Let my father be sacrificed for you. Take one of these two she-camels of mine&quot; The Prophet<br/>
said. I will take it only after paying its price.&quot; So we prepared their baggage and put their journey<br/>
food In a leather bag. And Asma&#039; bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the<br/>
leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr<br/>
went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. &#039;Abdullah bin Abu<br/>
Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so<br/>
that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among<br/>
them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would<br/>
understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. &#039;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed<br/>
slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to<br/>
them when an hour had passed after the &#039;Isha prayer. They would sleep soundly till &#039;Amir bin<br/>
Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights.<br/>
