<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 588:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:<br/>
A man came to the Prophet and said, &quot;My brother has some abdominal trouble.&quot; The Prophet said<br/>
to him &quot;Let him drink honey.&quot; The man came for the second time and the Prophet said to him, &#039;Let<br/>
him drink honey.&quot; He came for the third time and the Prophet said, &quot;Let him drink honey.&quot; He returned<br/>
again and said, &quot;I have done that &#039; The Prophet then said, &quot;Allah has said the truth, but your<br/>
brother&#039;s abdomen has told a lie. Let him drink honey.&quot; So he made him drink honey and he was<br/>
cured.<br/>
