<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 476:<br/><br/>
Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqua&#039;:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever has slaughtered a sacrifice should not keep anything of Its meat after<br/>
three days.&quot; When it was the next year the people said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Shall we do as we did last<br/>
year?&quot; He said, &#039; Eat of it and feed of it to others and store of it for in that year the people were having<br/>
a hard time and I wanted you to help (the needy).&quot;<br/>
