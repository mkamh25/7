<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 398:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Qatada:<br/>
that once he was with Allah&#039;s Apostle (on the way to Mecca). When he had covered some of the<br/>
way to Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind the<br/>
Prophet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rode<br/>
his horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to<br/>
hand him his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it.<br/>
Some of the Companions of Allah&#039;s Apostle ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle they asked him about that. He said, &quot;It was meal given to you by Allah.&quot;<br/>
