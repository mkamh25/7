<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 742:<br/><br/>
Narrated Said Al-Maqburi:<br/>
&#039;Ubai bin Juraij said to &#039;Abdullah Ben &#039;Umar, &quot;I see you doing four things which are not done by<br/>
your friends.&quot; Ibn &#039;Umar said, &quot;What are they, O Ibn Juraij?&quot; He said, &quot;I see that you do not touch except<br/>
the two Yemenite corners of the Ka&#039;ba (while performing the Tawaf): and I see you wearing the<br/>
Sabtiyya shoes; and I see you dyeing (your hair) with Sufra; and I see that when you are in Mecca,<br/>
the people assume the state of Ihram on seeing the crescent (on the first day of Dhul-Hijja) while you<br/>
do not assume the state of Ihram till the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijja).&quot; &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Umar said<br/>
to him, &quot;As for the corners of the Ka&#039;ba, I have not seen Allah&#039;s Apostle touching except the two Yemenite<br/>
corners, As for the Sabtiyya shoes, I saw Allah&#039;s Apostle wearing leather shoes that had no<br/>
hair, and he used to perform the ablution while wearing them. Therefore, I like to wear such shoes.<br/>
As regards dyeing with Sufra, I saw Allah&#039;s Apostle dyeing his hair with it, so I like to dye (my hair)<br/>
with it. As regards the crescent (of Dhul-Hijja), I have not seen Allah&#039;s Apostle assuming the state of<br/>
Ihram till his she-camel set out (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja).&quot;<br/>
