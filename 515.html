<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 515:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Abu Talha had the largest number of datepalms from amongst the Ansars of Medina. The dearest<br/>
of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was facing the (Prophet&#039;s) Mosque. Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
used to enter it and drink of its good fresh water. When the Holy Verse:-- &#039;By no means shall you attain<br/>
righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#039; (3.92) was revealed, Abu<br/>
Talha got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Allah says: By no means shall you attain righteousness unless<br/>
you spend of that which you love,&#039; and the dearest of my property to me is the Bairuha garden<br/>
and I want to give it in charity in Allah&#039;s Cause, seeking to be rewarded by Allah for that. So you can<br/>
spend it, O Allah&#039;s Apostle, where-ever Allah instructs you. &#039; Allah s Apostle said, &quot;Good! That is a<br/>
perishable (or profitable) wealth&quot; (&#039;Abdullah is in doubt as to which word was used.) He said, &quot;I have<br/>
heard what you have said but in my opinion you&#039;d better give it to your kith and kin.&quot; On that Abu<br/>
Talha said, &quot;I will do so, O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; Abu Talha distributed that garden among his kith and kin<br/>
and cousins.<br/>
