<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 22:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
The Prophet stayed for three days between Khaibar and Medina, and there he consummated his<br/>
marriage to Safiyya bint Huyai. I invited the Muslims to the wedding banquet in which neither meat<br/>
nor bread was offered. He ordered for leather dining-sheets to be spread, and dates, dried yoghurt<br/>
and butter were laid on it, and that was the Prophet&#039;s wedding banquet. The Muslims wondered, &quot;Is<br/>
she (Saffiyya) considered as his wife or his slave girl?&quot; Then they said, &quot;If he orders her to veil herself,<br/>
she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order her to veil herself, she will be<br/>
a slave girl. So when the Prophet proceeded from there, he spared her a space behind him (on his<br/>
she-camel) and put a screening veil between her and the people.<br/>
