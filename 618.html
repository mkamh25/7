<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 618:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Saud As-Sa&#039;idi:<br/>
When the helmet broke on the head of the Prophet and his face became covered with blood and<br/>
his incisor tooth broke (i.e. during the battle of Uhud), &#039;Ali used to bring water in his shield while<br/>
Fatima was washing the blood off his face. When Fatima saw that the bleeding increased because of<br/>
the water, she took a mat (of palm leaves), burnt it, and stuck it (the burnt ashes) on the wound of<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle, whereupon the bleeding stopped.<br/>
