<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 79:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#039;idi:<br/>
While I was (sitting) among the people in the company of Allah&#039;s Apostle a woman stood up and<br/>
said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! She has given herself in marriage to you; please give your opinion of her.&quot;<br/>
The Prophet did not give her any reply. She again stood up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! She has given<br/>
herself (in marriage) to you; so please give your opinion of her. The Prophet did not give her any<br/>
reply. She again stood up for the third time and said, &quot;She has given herself in marriage to you: so<br/>
give your opinion of her.&quot; So a man stood up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Marry her to me.&quot; The<br/>
Prophet asked him, &quot;Have you got anything?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go and search for<br/>
something, even if it were an iron ring.&quot; The man went and searched and then returned saying, &quot;I<br/>
could not find anything, not even an iron ring.&quot; Then the Prophet said, &quot;Do you know something of<br/>
the Quran (by heart)?&quot; He replied, &quot;I know (by heart) such Sura and such Sura.&quot; The Prophet said,<br/>
&quot;Go! I have married her to you for what you know of the Quran (by heart).&quot;<br/>
