<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 54:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
A woman presented herself to the Prophet (for marriage). A man said to him, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! (If<br/>
you are not in need of her) marry her to me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;What have you got?&quot; The man said, &quot;I<br/>
have nothing.&quot; The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Go and search for something) even if it were an iron ring.&quot;<br/>
The man went and returned saying, &quot;No, I have not found anything, not even an iron ring; but this is<br/>
my (Izar) waist sheet, and half of it is for her.&quot; He had no Rida&#039; (upper garment). The Prophet said,<br/>
&quot;What will she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing over her; and if she<br/>
wears it, you will have nothing over you.&quot; So the man sat down and when he had sat a long time, he<br/>
got up (to leave). When the Prophet saw him (leaving), he called him back, or the man was called<br/>
(for him), and he said to the man, &quot;How much of the Quran do you know (by heart)?&quot; The man<br/>
replied I know such Sura and such Sura (by heart),&quot; naming the Suras The Prophet said, &quot;I have married<br/>
her to you for what you know of the Quran &quot;<br/>
