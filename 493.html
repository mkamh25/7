Volume 7, Book 69, Number 493:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Umar:<br/>
&#039;Umar delivered a sermon on the pulpit of Allah&#039;s Apostle, saying, &quot;Alcoholic drinks were prohibited<br/>
by Divine Order, and these drinks used to be prepared from five things, i.e., grapes, dates, wheat,<br/>
barley and honey. Alcoholic drink is that, that disturbs the mind.&quot; &#039;Umar added, &quot;I wish Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle had not left us before he had given us definite verdicts concerning three matters, i.e., how<br/>
much a grandfather may inherit (of his grandson), the inheritance of Al-Kalala (the deceased person<br/>
among whose heirs there is no father or son), and various types of Riba(1 ) (usury) .&quot;<br/>

that he heard the Prophet saying, &quot;From among my followers there will be some people who will<br/>
consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use<br/>
of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a<br/>
mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for<br/>
something, but they will say to him, &#039;Return to us tomorrow.&#039; Allah will destroy them during the<br/>
night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys<br/>
and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.&quot;<br/>
