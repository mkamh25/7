<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 567:<br/><br/>
Narrated Usama bin Zaid:<br/>
The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya velvet covering. He mounted me behind<br/>
him and went to visit Sad bin &#039;Ubada, and that had been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet<br/>
proceeded till he passed by a gathering in which &#039;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that<br/>
had been before &#039;Abdullah embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e.,<br/>
isolators and Jews. &#039;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the<br/>
donkey covered the gathering, &#039;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and said,<br/>
&quot;Do not trouble us with dust.&quot; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he invited<br/>
them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them some verses of the Holy Qur&#039;an. On that,<br/>
&#039;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &quot;O man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not<br/>
trouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach<br/>
him there.&quot; On that &#039;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our<br/>
gathering, for we love that.&quot; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing each other till<br/>
they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the<br/>
Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &quot;O<br/>
Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e., &#039;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&quot; Sad said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this<br/>
town (Medina decided unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on<br/>
his head, but when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&#039;Abdullah bin<br/>
Ubai) was grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way<br/>
you have seen.&quot;<br/>
