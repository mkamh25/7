<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 706:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha and &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Abbas:<br/>
When the disease of Allah&#039;s Apostle got aggravated, he covered his face with a Khamisa, but when<br/>
he became short of breath, he would remove it from his face and say, &quot;It is like that! May Allah curse<br/>
the Jews Christians because they took the graves of their prophets as places of worship.&quot; By that he<br/>
warned his follower of imitating them, by doing that which they did.<br/>
