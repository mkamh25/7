<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 772:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
I was with Allah&#039;s Apostle in one of the Markets of Medina. He left (the market) and so did I. Then<br/>
he asked thrice, &quot;Where is the small (child)?&quot; Then he said, &quot;Call Al-Hasan bin &#039;Ali.&quot; So Al-Hasan bin<br/>
&#039;Ali got up and started walking with a necklace (of beads) around his neck. The Prophet stretched his<br/>
hand out like this, and Al-Hasan did the same. The Prophet embraced him and said, &quot;0 Allah! l love<br/>
him, so please love him and love those who love him.&quot; Since Allah&#039;s Apostle said that. nothing has<br/>
been dearer to me than Al-Hasan.<br/>
