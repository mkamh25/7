<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 185:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#039;idi:<br/>
Uwaimir Al-&#039;Ajlani came to &#039;Asim bin Adi Al-Ansari and asked, &quot;O &#039;Asim! Tell me, if a man sees his<br/>
wife with another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him in Qisas, or what should<br/>
he do? O &#039;Asim! Please ask Allah&#039;s Apostle about that.&quot; &#039;Asim asked Allah&#039;s Apostle about that. Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#039;Asim heard from Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
was hard on him. When he returned to his family, &#039;Uwaimir came to him and said &quot;O &#039;Asim! What<br/>
did Allah&#039;s Apostle say to you?&quot; &#039;Asim said, &quot;You never bring me any good. Allah&#039;s Apostle disliked to<br/>
hear the problem which I asked him about.&quot; &#039;Uwaimir said, &quot;By Allah, I will not leave the matter till I<br/>
ask him about it.&quot; So &#039;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#039;s Apostle who was in the midst of the<br/>
people and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If a man finds with his wife another man, should he kill him,<br/>
whereupon you would kill him (in Qisas): or otherwise, what should he do?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Allah<br/>
has revealed something concerning the question of you and your wife. Go and bring her here.&quot; So<br/>
they both carried out the judgment of Lian, while I was present among the people (as a witness).<br/>
When both of them had finished, &#039;Uwaimir said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If I should now keep my wife<br/>
with me, then I have told a lie&quot;. Then he pronounced his decision to divorce her thrice before Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle ordered him to do so. (Ibn Shihab said, &quot;That was the tradition for all those who are involved<br/>
in a case of Lian.&quot;<br/>
