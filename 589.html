<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 589:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
Some people were sick and they said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Give us shelter and food. So when they<br/>
became healthy they said, &quot;The weather of Medina is not suitable for us.&quot; So he sent them to Al-Harra<br/>
with some she-camels of his and said, &quot;Drink of their milk.&quot; But when they became healthy, they<br/>
killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away his camels. The Prophet sent some people in their<br/>
pursuit. Then he got their hands and feet cut and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron.<br/>
I saw one of them licking the earth with his tongue till he died.<br/>
