<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 199:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
The wife of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas came to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I do not<br/>
blame Thabit for any defects in his character or his religion, but I am afraid that I (being a Muslim)<br/>
may become unthankful for Allah&#039;s Blessings.&quot; On that, Allah&#039;s Apostle said (to her), &#039;Will you return<br/>
his garden to him?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So she returned his garden to him and the Prophet told him to divorce<br/>
her.<br/>
