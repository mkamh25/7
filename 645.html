<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 645:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Said:<br/>
A group of the companions of Allah&#039;s Apostle proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near<br/>
one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe<br/>
people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a<br/>
scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, &quot;Will you go to<br/>
the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something<br/>
useful?&quot; They came to them and said, &quot;O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung<br/>
by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of<br/>
you anything useful?&quot; One of them replied, &quot;Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by<br/>
Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a<br/>
Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages.&quot; Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a<br/>
flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite)<br/>
and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been<br/>
sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the<br/>
Prophet&#039;s companions) said, &quot;Distribute (the sheep).&quot; But the one who treated with the Ruqya said,<br/>
&quot;Do not do that till we go to Allah&#039;s Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he<br/>
will order us.&quot; So they came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and mentioned the story to him and he said, &quot;How do<br/>
you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have<br/>
got) and assign for me a share with you.&quot;<br/>
