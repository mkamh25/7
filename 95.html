<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 95:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
I was ten years old when Allah&#039;s Apostle arrived at Medina. My mother and aunts used to urge me<br/>
to serve the Prophet regularly, and I served him for ten years. When the Prophet died I was twenty<br/>
years old, and I knew about the order of Al-Hijab (veiling of ladies) more than any other person<br/>
when it was revealed. It was revealed for the first time when Allah&#039;s Apostle had consummated his<br/>
marriage with Zainab bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited<br/>
the people to a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the<br/>
Prophet for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those<br/>
people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the threshold of &#039;Aisha&#039;s<br/>
dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along<br/>
with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting and had not gone. So the<br/>
Prophet again went away and I went away along with him. When we reached the threshold of<br/>
&#039;Aisha&#039;s dwelling place, he thought that they had left, and so he returned and I too, returned along<br/>
with him and found those people had left. Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him,<br/>
and the Verses of Al-Hijab were revealed.<br/>
