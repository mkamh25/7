<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 713:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Khalid bint Khalid:<br/>
The Prophet was given some clothes including a black Khamisa. The Prophet said, &quot;To whom shall<br/>
we give this to wear?&quot; The people kept silent whereupon the Prophet said, &quot;Fetch Um Khalid for me.&quot; I<br/>
(Um Khalid) was brought carried (as I was small girl at that time). The Prophet took the Khamisa in<br/>
his hands and made me wear it and said, &quot;May you live so long that your dress will wear out and you<br/>
will mend it many times.&quot; On the Khamisa there were some green or pale designs (The Prophet saw<br/>
these designs) and said, &quot;O Um Khalid! This is Sanah.&quot; (Sanah in a Ethiopian word meaning<br/>
beautiful).<br/>
