<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 232:<br/><br/>
Narrated Said bin Jubair:<br/>
I asked Ibn &#039;Umar about those who were involved in a case of Lien. He said, &quot;The Prophet said to<br/>
those who were involved in a case of Lien, &#039;Your accounts are with Allah. One of you two is a liar,<br/>
and you (the husband) have no right over her (she is divorced).&quot; The man said, &#039;What about my<br/>
property (Mahr) ?&#039; The Prophet said, &#039;You have no right to get back your property. If you have told<br/>
the truth about her then your property was for the consummation of your marriage with her; and if<br/>
you told a lie about her, then you are less rightful to get your property back.&#039; &quot; Sufyan, a sub-narrator<br/>
said: I learned the Hadith from &#039;Amr. Narrated Aiyub: I heard Sa&#039;id bin Jubair saying, &quot;I asked Ibn<br/>
&#039;Umar, &#039;If a man (accuses his wife for an illegal sexual intercourse and) carries out the process of<br/>
Lian (what will happen)?&#039; Ibn &#039;Umar set two of his fingers apart. (Sufyan set his index finger and<br/>
middle finger apart.) Ibn &#039;Umar said, &#039;The Prophet separated the couple of Bani Al-Ajlan by divorce<br/>
and said thrice, &quot;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent (to Allah)?&#039; &quot;<br/>
