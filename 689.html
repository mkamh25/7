<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 689:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle has set forth an example for a miser and a charitable person by comparing them to<br/>
two men wearing two iron cloaks and their hands are raised to their breasts and necks. Whenever<br/>
the charitable man tries to give a charitable gift, his iron cloak expands till it becomes so wide that it<br/>
will cover his fingertips and obliterate his tracks And, whenever the miser wants to give a charitable<br/>
gift, his cloak becomes very tight over him and every ring gets stuck to its place Abu Huraira added; I<br/>
saw Allah&#039;s Apostle putting his finger in the (chest) pocket of his shirt like that If you but saw him<br/>
trying to widen (the opening of his shirt) but it did not widen<br/>
