<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 16:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:<br/>
While we were returning from a Ghazwa (Holy Battle) with the Prophet, I started driving my<br/>
camel fast, as it was a lazy camel A rider came behind me and pricked my camel with a spear he had<br/>
with him, and then my camel started running as fast as the best camel you may see. Behold! The<br/>
rider was the Prophet himself. He said, &#039;What makes you in such a hurry?&quot; I replied, I am newly<br/>
married &quot; He said, &quot;Did you marry a virgin or a matron? I replied, &quot;A matron.&quot; He said, &quot;Why didn&#039;t<br/>
you marry a young girl so that you may play with her and she with you?&quot; When we were about to<br/>
enter (Medina), the Prophet said, &quot;Wait so that you may enter (Medina) at night so that the lady of<br/>
unkempt hair may comb her hair and the one whose husband has been absent may shave her pubic<br/>
region.<br/>
