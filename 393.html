<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:<br/><br/>
Narrated Adi bin Hatim:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#039;s Name on sending<br/>
it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then<br/>
you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join<br/>
other hounds, and Allah&#039;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an<br/>
animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if<br/>
you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears<br/>
no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is<br/>
found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&quot; And it has also been narrated by &#039;Adi bin Hatim that he<br/>
asked the Prophet &quot;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days<br/>
he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;He can eat if he<br/>
wishes.&quot;<br/>
