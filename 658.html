<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 658:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
A man called Labid bin al-A&#039;sam from the tribe of Bani Zaraiq worked magic on Allah&#039;s Apostle till<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle started imagining that he had done a thing that he had not really done. One day or<br/>
one night he was with us, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period, and then said, &quot;O &#039;Aisha!<br/>
Do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I have asked him about? Two men<br/>
came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. One of them said to his<br/>
companion, &quot;What is the disease of this man?&quot; The other replied, &quot;He is under the effect of magic.&#039;<br/>
The first one asked, &#039;Who has worked the magic on him?&#039; The other replied, &quot;Labid bin Al-A&#039;sam.&#039; The<br/>
first one asked, &#039;What material did he use?&#039; The other replied, &#039;A comb and the hairs stuck to it and<br/>
the skin of pollen of a male date palm.&#039; The first one asked, &#039;Where is that?&#039; The other replied, &#039;(That<br/>
is) in the well of Dharwan;&#039; &quot; So Allah&#039;s Apostle along with some of his companions went there and<br/>
came back saying, &quot;O &#039;Aisha, the color of its water is like the infusion of Henna leaves. The tops of the<br/>
date-palm trees near it are like the heads of the devils.&quot; I asked. &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle? Why did you not<br/>
show it (to the people)?&quot; He said, &quot;Since Allah cured me, I disliked to let evil spread among the<br/>
people.&quot; Then he ordered that the well be filled up with earth.<br/>
