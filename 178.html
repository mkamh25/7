<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 178:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Umar:<br/>
that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah&#039;s Apostle .<br/>
&#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Allah&#039;s Apostle about that. Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Order him (your son) to<br/>
take her back and keep her till she is clean and then to wait till she gets her next period and becomes<br/>
clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he<br/>
can divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the prescribed period which<br/>
Allah has fixed for the women meant to be divorced.&quot;<br/>
