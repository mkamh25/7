<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 411:<br/><br/>
Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:<br/>
that he said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We have no knife.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;if the killing tool causes<br/>
blood to gush out, and if Allah&#039;s Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughtered animal). But do not<br/>
slaughter with a nail or a tooth, for the nail is the knife of Ethiopians and a tooth is a bone.&quot; Suddenly<br/>
a camel ran away and it was stopped (with an arrow). The Prophet then said, &quot;Of these camels there<br/>
are some which are as wild as wild beasts; so if one of them runs away from you and you cannot<br/>
catch it, treat it in this manner (i.e. shoot it with an arrow).&quot;<br/>
