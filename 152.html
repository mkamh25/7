<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 152:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
While the Prophet was in the house of one of his wives, one of the mothers of the believers sent a<br/>
meal in a dish. The wife at whose house the Prophet was, struck the hand of the servant, causing the<br/>
dish to fall and break. The Prophet gathered the broken pieces of the dish and then started collecting<br/>
on them the food which had been in the dish and said, &quot;Your mother (my wife) felt jealous.&quot; Then he<br/>
detained the servant till a (sound) dish was brought from the wife at whose house he was. He gave<br/>
the sound dish to the wife whose dish had been broken and kept the broken one at the house where<br/>
it had been broken.<br/>
