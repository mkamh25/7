<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 266:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sad:<br/>
The Prophet visited me at Mecca while I was ill. I said (to him), &quot;I have property; May I bequeath<br/>
all my property in Allah&#039;s Cause?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;Half of it?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;One third of<br/>
it?&quot; He said, &quot;One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you&#039;d better leave your inheritors<br/>
wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa<br/>
for you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. Anyhow Allah may let you recover,<br/>
so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you.&quot;<br/>
