<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 336:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said to Abu Talha, &quot;Seek one of your boys to serve me.&quot; Abu Talha mounted me behind<br/>
him (on his riding animal) and took me (to the Prophet ). So I used to serve Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
whenever he dismounted (to stay somewhere). I used to hear him saying very often, &quot;O Allah! I seek<br/>
refuge with You from, having worries sadness, helplessness, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, from<br/>
being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other persons unjustly.&quot; I kept on serving till<br/>
we -returned from the battle of Khaibar. The Prophet then brought Safiyya bint Huyai whom he had<br/>
won from the war booty. I saw him folding up a gown or a garment for her to sit on behind him (on<br/>
his she-camel). When he reached As-Sahba&#039;, he prepared Hais and placed it on a dining sheet. Then<br/>
he sent me to invite men, who (came and) ate; and that was his and Safiyya&#039;s wedding banquet. Then<br/>
the Prophet proceeded, and when he saw (noticed) the mountain of Uhud, he said, &quot;This mountain<br/>
loves us, and we love it.&quot; When we approached Medina, he said, &quot;O Allah! I make the area between<br/>
its two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham has made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless their Mudd<br/>
and Sa (special kinds of measure).&quot;<br/>
