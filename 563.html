<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 563:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sad:<br/>
I became seriously ill at Mecca and the Prophet came to visit me. I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I shall<br/>
leave behind me a good fortune, but my heir is my only daughter; shall I bequeath two third of my<br/>
property to be spent in charity and leave one third (for my heir)?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;Shall I bequeath<br/>
half and leave half?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;Shall I bequeath one third and leave two thirds?&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;One third is alright, though even one third is too much.&quot; Then he placed his hand on his<br/>
forehead and passed it over my face and abdomen and said, &quot;O Allah! Cure Sad and complete his<br/>
emigration.&quot; I feel as if I have been feeling the coldness of his hand on my liver ever since.<br/>
