<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 715:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ikrima:<br/>
Rifa&#039;a divorced his wife whereupon &#039;AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. &#039;Aisha<br/>
said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and<br/>
showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each<br/>
other, so when Allah&#039;s Apostle came, &#039;Aisha said, &quot;I have not seen any woman suffering as much as<br/>
the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!&quot; When &#039;AbdurRahman heard that<br/>
his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, &quot;By Allah! I<br/>
have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this,&quot; holding and showing<br/>
the fringe of her garment, &#039;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;By Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! She has told a lie! I am<br/>
very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa&#039;a.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
said, to her, &quot;If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa&#039;a unless<br/>
Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you.&quot; Then the Prophet saw two boys with &#039;Abdur-<br/>
Rahman and asked (him), &quot;Are these your sons?&quot; On that &#039;AbdurRahman said, &quot;Yes.&quot; The Prophet said,<br/>
&quot;You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a<br/>
crow resembles a crow,&quot;<br/>
