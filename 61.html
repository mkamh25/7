<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 61:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Hasan:<br/>
concerning the Verse: &#039;Do not prevent them&#039; (2.232) Ma&#039;qil bin Yasar told me that it was revealed<br/>
in his connection. He said, &quot;I married my sister to a man and he divorced her, and when her days of<br/>
&#039;Idda (three menstrual periods) were over, the man came again and asked for her hand, but I said to<br/>
him, &#039;I married her to you and made her your bed (your wife) and favored you with her, but you divorced<br/>
her. Now you come to ask for her hand again? No, by Allah, she will never go back to you<br/>
(again)!&#039; That man was not a bad man and his wife wanted to go back to him. So Allah revealed this<br/>
Verse: &#039;Do not prevent them.&#039; (2.232) So I said, &#039;Now I will do it (let her go back to him), O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle.&quot;So he married her to him again.<br/>
