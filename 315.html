<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 315:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
We used to be happy on Fridays, for there was an old lady who used to pull out the roots of Silq<br/>
and put it in a cooking pot with some barley. When we had finished the prayer, we would visit her<br/>
and she would present that dish before us. So we used to be happy on Fridays because of that, and we<br/>
never used to take our meals or have a mid-day nap except after the Friday prayer. By Allah, that<br/>
meal contained no fat.<br/>
