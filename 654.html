<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 654:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira :<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle gave his verdict about two ladies of the Hudhail tribe who had fought each other<br/>
and one of them had hit the other with a stone. The stone hit her abdomen and as she was pregnant,<br/>
the blow killed the child in her womb. They both filed their case with the Prophet and he judged that<br/>
the blood money for what was in her womb. was a slave or a female slave. The guardian of the lady<br/>
who was fined said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Shall I be fined for a creature that has neither drunk nor<br/>
eaten, neither spoke nor cried? A case like that should be nullified.&quot; On that the Prophet said, &quot;This is<br/>
one of the brothers of soothsayers.<br/>
