<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 193:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing<br/>
the &#039;Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa,<br/>
the daughter of &#039;Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for<br/>
that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that<br/>
she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I<br/>
said, &quot;By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so).&quot; So I said to Sada bint<br/>
Zam&#039;a &quot;The Prophet will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: &#039;Have you taken Maghafir<br/>
(a bad-smelling gum)?&#039; He will say, &#039;No.&#039; Then say to him: &#039;Then what is this bad smell which i smell<br/>
from you?&#039; He will say to you, &#039;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&#039; Then say: Perhaps the bees of that<br/>
honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-&#039;Urfut.&#039; I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the<br/>
same.&quot; Later Sada said, &quot;By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet ) stood at the door, I was about to say to<br/>
him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you.&quot; So when the Prophet came near<br/>
Sada, she said to him, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Have you taken Maghafir?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; She said. &quot;Then<br/>
what is this bad smell which I detect on you?&quot; He said, &quot;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&quot; She said,<br/>
&quot;Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-&#039;Urfut tree.&quot; When he came to me, I also said the same,<br/>
and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet again went to Hafsa, she<br/>
said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Shall I give you more of that drink?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not in need of it.&quot; Sada<br/>
said, &quot;By Allah, we deprived him (of it).&quot; I said to her, &quot;Keep quiet.&quot; &#039;<br/>
