<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 463:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Bara&#039; bin &#039;Azib:<br/>
An uncle of mine called Abu Burda, slaughtered his sacrifice before the &#039;Id prayer. So Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said to him, &quot;Your (slaughtered) sheep was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&quot; Abu Burda said, &quot;O<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have got a domestic kid.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will<br/>
not be permissible for anybody other than you&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice<br/>
before the (&#039;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the<br/>
prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&quot;<br/>
