<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 590:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet ordered them to follow his shepherd,<br/>
i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they followed the shepherd<br/>
that is the camels and drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy. Then they killed<br/>
the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the Prophet he sent some people<br/>
in their pursuit. When they were brought, he cut their hands and feet and their eyes were branded<br/>
with heated pieces of iron.<br/>
