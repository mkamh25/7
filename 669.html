<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 669:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
When Khaibar was conquered, Allah&#039;s Apostle was presented with a poisoned (roasted) sheep. Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said, &quot;Collect for me all the Jews present in this area.&quot; (When they were gathered) Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said to them, &quot;I am going to ask you about something; will you tell me the truth?&quot; They<br/>
replied, &quot;Yes, O Abal-Qasim!&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said to them, &quot;Who is your father?&quot; They said, &quot;Our<br/>
father is so-and-so.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;You have told a lie. for your father is so-and-so,&quot; They said,<br/>
&quot;No doubt, you have said the truth and done the correct thing.&quot; He again said to them, &quot;If I ask you<br/>
about something; will you tell me the truth?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, O Abal-Qasim! And if we should tell<br/>
a lie you will know it as you have known it regarding our father,&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle then asked, &quot;Who<br/>
are the people of the (Hell) Fire?&quot; They replied, &quot;We will remain in the (Hell) Fire for a while and<br/>
then you (Muslims) will replace us in it&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said to them. &#039;&#039;You will abide in it with ignominy.<br/>
By Allah, we shall never replace you in it at all.&quot; Then he asked them again, &quot;If I ask you something,<br/>
will you tell me the truth?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked. &quot;Have you put the poison in this roasted<br/>
sheep?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes,&quot; He asked, &quot;What made you do that?&quot; They replied, &quot;We intended to<br/>
learn if you were a liar in which case we would be relieved from you, and if you were a prophet<br/>
then it would not harm you.&quot;<br/>
