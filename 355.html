<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 355:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin Umar:<br/>
While we were sitting with the Prophet a spadix of palm tree was brought to him. The Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;There is a tree among the trees which is as blessed as a Muslim&quot; I thought that it was the date<br/>
palm tree and intended to say, &quot;It is the date-palm tree, O Allah&#039;s Apostle!&quot; but I looked behind to see<br/>
that I was the tenth and youngest of ten men present there, so I kept quiet&#039; Then the Prophet said, &quot;It<br/>
is the datepalm tree.&quot;<br/>
