<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 214:<br/><br/>
Narrated Yazid:<br/>
(the Maula of Munba&#039;ith) The Prophet was asked regarding the case of a lost sheep. He said, &quot;You<br/>
should take it, because it is for you, or for your brother, or for the wolf.&quot; Then he was asked about a<br/>
lost camel. He got angry and his face became red and he said (to the questioner), &quot;You have nothing<br/>
to do with it; it has its feet and its water container with it; it can go on drinking water and eating<br/>
trees till its owner meets it.&quot; And then the Prophet was asked about a Luqata (money found by somebody).<br/>
He said, &quot;Remember and recognize its tying material and its container, and make public announcement<br/>
about it for one year. If somebody comes and identifies it (then give it to him), otherwise<br/>
add it to your property.&quot;<br/>
