<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 610:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas and &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Abu Bakr kissed (the forehead of) the Prophet when he was dead. &#039;Aisha added: We put medicine<br/>
in one side of his mouth but he started waving us not to insert the medicine into his mouth. We said,<br/>
&quot;He dislikes the medicine as a patient usually does.&quot; But when he came to his senses he said, &quot;Did I not<br/>
forbid you to put medicine (by force) in the side of my mouth?&quot; We said, &quot;We thought it was just because<br/>
a patient usually dislikes medicine.&quot; He said, &quot;None of those who are in the house but will be<br/>
forced to take medicine in the side of his mouth while I am watching, except Al-&#039;Abbas, for he had<br/>
not witnessed your deed.&quot;<br/>
