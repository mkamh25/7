<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 138:<br/><br/>
Narrated al-Qasim:<br/>
Aisha said that whenever the Prophet intended to go on a journey, he drew lots among his wives<br/>
(so as to take one of them along with him). During one of his journeys the lot fell on &#039;Aisha and Hafsa.<br/>
When night fell the Prophet would ride beside &#039;Aisha and talk with her. One night Hafsa said to<br/>
&#039;Aisha, &quot;Won&#039;t you ride my camel tonight and I ride yours, so that you may see (me) and I see (you)<br/>
(in new situation)?&quot; &#039;Aisha said, &quot;Yes, (I agree.)&quot; So &#039;Aisha rode, and then the Prophet came towards<br/>
&#039;Aisha&#039;s camel on which Hafsa was riding. He greeted Hafsa and then proceeded (beside her) till they<br/>
dismounted (on the way). &#039;Aisha missed him, and so, when they dismounted, she put her legs in the<br/>
Idhkhir and said, &quot;O Lord (Allah)! Send a scorpion or a snake to bite me for I am not to blame him<br/>
(the Prophet ).<br/>
