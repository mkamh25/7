<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 334:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abis:<br/>
I asked &#039;Aisha &quot;Did the Prophet forbid eating the meat of sacrifices offered on &#039;Id-ul-Adha for more<br/>
than three days&quot; She said, &quot;The Prophet did not do this except in the year when the people were<br/>
hungry, so he wanted the rich to feed the poor. But later we used to store even a trotter of a sheep to<br/>
eat it fifteen days later.&quot; She was asked, &quot;What compelled you to do so?&quot; She smiled and said, &quot;The<br/>
family of Muhammad did not eat to their satisfaction white bread with meat soup for three successive<br/>
days till he met Allah.&quot;<br/>
