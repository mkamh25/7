<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 844:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet)<br/>
I bought a cushion having pictures on it. When Allah&#039;s Apostle saw it, he stopped at the gate and<br/>
did not enter. I noticed the signs of hatred (for that) on his face! I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I turn to<br/>
Allah and His Apostle in repentance! What sin have I committed?&quot; He said, &quot;What about this cushion?&quot;<br/>
I said, &#039;I bought it for you to sit on and recline on.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;The makers of these<br/>
pictures will be punished (severely) on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them, &#039;Make<br/>
alive what you have created.&#039;&quot; He added, &quot;Angels do not enter a house in which there are pictures.&quot;<br/>
