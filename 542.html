<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 542:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Asim al-Ahwal:<br/>
I saw the drinking bowl of the Prophet with Anas bin Malik, and it had been broken, and he had<br/>
mended it with silver plates. That drinking bowl was quite wide and made of Nadar wood, Anas said,<br/>
&quot;I gave water to the Prophet in that bowl more than so-and-so (for a long period).&quot; Ibn Sirin said:<br/>
Around that bowl there was an iron ring, and Anas wanted to replace it with a silver or gold ring,<br/>
but Abu Talha said to him, &quot;Do not change a thing that Allah&#039;s Apostle has made.&quot; So Anas left it as it<br/>
was.<br/>
