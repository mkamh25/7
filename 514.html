<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 514:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas: Allah&#039;s Apostle drank milk and then rinsed his mouth and said, &quot;It contains<br/>
fat. The Prophet added: I was raised to the Lote Tree and saw four rivers, two of which were coming<br/>
out and two going in. Those which were coming out were the Nile and the Euphrates, and those<br/>
which were going in were two rivers in paradise. Then I was given three bowls, one containing milk,<br/>
and another containing honey, and a third containing wine. I took the bowl containing milk and<br/>
drank it. It was said to me, &quot;You and your followers will be on the right path (of Islam).&quot;<br/>
