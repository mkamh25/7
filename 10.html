<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 10:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
&#039;Abdur-Rahman bin &#039;Auf came (from Mecca to Medina) and the Prophet made a bond of brotherhood<br/>
between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#039; Al-Ansari. Al-Ansari had two wives, so he suggested that<br/>
&#039;Abdur-Rahman take half, his wives and property. &#039;Abdur-Rahman replied, &quot;May Allah bless you<br/>
with your wives and property. Kindly show me the market.&quot; So &#039;Abdur-Rahman went to the market<br/>
and gained (in bargains) some dried yoghurt and some butter. After a few days the Prophet saw Abdur-<br/>
Rahman with some yellow stains on his clothes and asked him, &quot;What is that, O &#039;Abdur-Rahman?&quot;<br/>
He replied, &quot;I had married an Ansari woman.&quot; The Prophet asked, &quot;How much Mahr did you<br/>
give her?&quot; He replied, &quot;The weight of one (date) stone of gold.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Offer a banquet,<br/>
even with one sheep.&quot;<br/>
