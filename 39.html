<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 39:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
that the Prophet entered upon her while a man was sitting with her. Signs of anger seemed to appear<br/>
on his face as if he disliked that. She said, &quot;Here is my (foster) brother.&quot; He said, &quot;Be sure as to<br/>
who is your foster brother, for foster suckling relationship is established only when milk is the only<br/>
food of the child.&quot;<br/>
