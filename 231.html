<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 231:<br/><br/>
Narrated Said bin Jubair:<br/>
I asked Ibn &#039;Umar, &quot;(What is the verdict if) a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse?&quot;<br/>
Ibn &#039;Umar said, &quot;The Prophet separated (by divorce) the couple of Bani Al-Ajlan, and said, (to them),<br/>
&#039;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?&#039; But both of them refused. He<br/>
again said, &#039;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?&#039; But both of them refused.<br/>
So he separated them by divorce.&quot; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator said: &#039;Amr bin Dinar said to me,<br/>
&quot;There is something else in this Hadith which you have not mentioned. It goes thus: The man said,<br/>
&#039;What about my money (i.e. the Mahr that I have given to my wife)?&#039; It was said, &#039;You have no right<br/>
to restore any money, for if you have spoken the truth (as regards the accusation), you have also<br/>
consummated your marriage with her; and if you have told a lie, you are less rightful to have your<br/>
money back.&#039; &quot;)<br/>
