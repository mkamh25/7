<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 293:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &quot;I have heard the voice of Allah&#039;s Apostle which was feeble, and I<br/>
think that he is hungry. Have you got something (to eat)?&quot; She took out some loaves of barley bread,<br/>
then took her face-covering sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment<br/>
and turned the rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#039;s Apostle . I went with that, and<br/>
found Allah&#039;s Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
asked me, &quot;Have you been sent by Abu Talha?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked, &quot;With some food (for us)?&quot; I<br/>
said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then Allah&#039;s Apostle said to all those who were with him, &quot;Get up!&quot; He set out (and all the<br/>
people accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then<br/>
said, &quot;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#039;s Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not have food<br/>
enough to feed them all.&quot; She said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; So Abu Talha went out till he<br/>
met Allah&#039;s Apostle. Then Abu Talha and Allah&#039;s Apostle came and entered the house. Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
said, &quot;Um Sulaim ! Bring whatever you have.&quot; She brought that very bread. The Prophet ordered that<br/>
it be crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added, &quot;Admit ten (men).&quot; So they<br/>
were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The Prophet then said, &quot;Admit ten (more).&quot; They were admitted,<br/>
ate their full, and went out. He then again said, &quot;Admit ten more!&quot; They were admitted, ate<br/>
their fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they were<br/>
eighty men.<br/>
