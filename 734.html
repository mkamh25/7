<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 734:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
For one year I wanted to ask &#039;Umar about the two women who helped each other against the<br/>
Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees<br/>
of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &quot;(They were)<br/>
&#039;Aisha and Hafsa.&quot; Then he added, &quot;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Prelslamic<br/>
period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give<br/>
them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute<br/>
between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &#039;Strange! You can<br/>
retort in this way?&#039; She said, &#039;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle?&#039; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &#039;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&#039; I first<br/>
went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &#039;O &#039;Umar! It surprises<br/>
me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle and his wives.&#039; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was<br/>
absent from Allah&#039;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on<br/>
that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had<br/>
happened as regards news from Allah&#039;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands<br/>
had surrendered to Allah&#039;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he<br/>
might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &#039;A great event has happened!&#039; I asked him,<br/>
&#039;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&#039; He said, &#039;Greater than that! Allah&#039;s Apostle has divorced<br/>
his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended<br/>
to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said,<br/>
&quot;Ask the permission for me to enter.&quot; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat<br/>
that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm<br/>
fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned<br/>
what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&quot; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for<br/>
details)<br/>
