<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 631:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
During the Prophet&#039;s fatal illness, he used to recite the Mu&#039;auwidhat (Surat An-Nas and Surat Al-<br/>
Falaq) and then blow his breath over his body. When his illness was aggravated, I used to recite those<br/>
two Suras and blow my breath over him and make him rub his body with his own hand for its blessings.&quot;<br/>
(Ma&#039;mar asked Az-Zuhri: How did the Prophet use to blow? Az-Zuhri said: He used to blow on<br/>
his hands and then passed them over his face.)<br/>
