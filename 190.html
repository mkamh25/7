<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 190:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
A man divorced his wife and she married another man who proved to be impotent and divorced<br/>
her. She could not get her satisfaction from him, and after a while he divorced her. Then she came to<br/>
the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! My first husband divorced me and then I married another<br/>
man who entered upon me to consummate his marriage but he proved to be impotent and did not<br/>
approach me except once during which he benefited nothing from me. Can I remarry my first husband<br/>
in this case?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;It is unlawful to marry your first husband till the other husband<br/>
consummates his marriage with you.&quot;<br/>
