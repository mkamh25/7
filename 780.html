<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 780:<br/><br/>
Narrated Nafi&#039;:<br/>
Ibn Umar said, The Prophet said, &#039;Do the opposite of what the pagans do. Keep the beards and cut<br/>
the moustaches short.&#039; Whenever Ibn &#039;Umar performed the Hajj or &#039;Umra, he used to hold his beard<br/>
with his hand and cut whatever moustaches. Ibn Umar used to cut his moustache so short that the<br/>
whiteness of his skin (above the upper lip) was visible, and he used to cut (the hair) between his<br/>
moustaches and his beard.<br/>
