<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 750:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Juhaifa:<br/>
I came to the Prophet while he was inside a red leather tent, and I saw Bilal taking the remaining<br/>
water of the ablution of the Prophet, and the people were taking of that water and rubbing it on their<br/>
faces; and whoever could not get anything of it, would share the moisture of the hand of his companion<br/>
(and then rub it on his face).<br/>
