<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 206:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
Barira&#039;s husband was a slave called Mughith, as if I am seeing him now, going behind Barira and<br/>
weeping with his tears flowing down his beard. The Prophet said to &#039;Abbas, &quot;O &#039;Abbas ! are you not<br/>
astonished at the love of Mughith for Barira and the hatred of Barira for Mughith?&quot; The Prophet then<br/>
said to Barira, &quot;Why don&#039;t you return to him?&quot; She said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Do you order me to do<br/>
so?&quot; He said, &quot;No, I only intercede for him.&quot; She said, &quot;I am not in need of him.&quot;<br/>
