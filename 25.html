<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 25:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Abu Hudhaifa bin &#039;Utba bin Rabi&#039;a bin Abdi Shams who had witnessed the battle of Badr along<br/>
with the Prophet adopted Salim as his son, to whom he married his niece, Hind bint Al-Walid bin<br/>
&#039;Utba bin Rabi&#039;a; and Salim was the freed slave of an Ansar woman, just as the Prophet had adopted<br/>
Zaid as his son. It was the custom in the Pre-lslamic Period that if somebody adopted a boy, the<br/>
people would call him the son of the adoptive father and he would be the latter&#039;s heir. But when Allah<br/>
revealed the Divine Verses: &#039;Call them by (the names of) their fathers . . . your freed-slaves,&#039;<br/>
(33.5) the adopted persons were called by their fathers&#039; names. The one whose father was not<br/>
known, would be regarded as a Maula and your brother in religion. Later on Sahla bint Suhail bin<br/>
&#039;Amr Al-Quraishi Al-&#039;Amiri--and she was the wife of Abu- Hudhaifa bin &#039;Utba--came to the Prophet<br/>
and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We used to consider Salim as our (adopted) son, and now Allah has revealed<br/>
what you know (regarding adopted sons).&quot; The sub-narrator then mentioned the rest of the<br/>
narration.<br/>
