<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 417:<br/><br/>
Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We are going to face the enemy tomorrow and we do not have knives.&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;Hurry up (in killing the animal). If the killing tool causes blood to flow out, and if Allah&#039;s<br/>
Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughtered animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I will<br/>
tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&quot; Then we<br/>
got some camels and sheep as war booty, and one of those camels ran away, whereupon a man shot<br/>
it with an arrow and stopped it. Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Of these camels there are some which are as<br/>
wild as wild beasts, so if one of them (runs away and) makes you tired, treat it in this manner.&quot;<br/>
