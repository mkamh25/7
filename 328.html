<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 328:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) that whenever one of her relatives died, the women assembled and then<br/>
dispersed (returned to their houses) except her relatives and close friends. She would order that a pot<br/>
of Talbina be cooked. Then Tharid (a dish prepared from meat and bread) would be prepared and<br/>
the Talbina would be poured on it. &#039;Aisha would say (to the women),&quot;Eat of it, for I heard Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle saying, &#039;The Talbina soothes the heart of the patient and relieves him from some of his sadness.&#039;<br/>
&quot;<br/>
