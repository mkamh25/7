<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 361:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
My mother, Um Sulaim, took a Mudd of barley grain, ground it and made porridge from it, and<br/>
pressed (over it), a butter skin she had with her. Then she sent me to the Prophet, and I reached him<br/>
while he was sitting with his companions. I invited him, whereupon he said, &quot;And those who are<br/>
with me?&#039; I returned and said, &quot;He says, &#039;And those who are with me?&quot; Abu Talha went out to him<br/>
and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! It is just a meal prepared by Um Sulaim.&quot; The Prophet entered and the<br/>
food was brought to him. He said, &quot;Let ten persons enter upon me.&quot; Those ten entered and ate their<br/>
fill. Again he said, &#039;Let ten (more) enter upon me.&quot; Those ten entered and ate their fill. Then he said,<br/>
&quot;Let ten (more) enter upon me.&quot; He called forty persons in all Then Allah&#039;s Apostle ate and got up. I<br/>
started looking (at the food) to see if it decreased or not.<br/>
