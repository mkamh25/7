<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 262:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Umar:<br/>
The Prophet said to those who were involved in a case of Lian, &quot;Your accounts are with Allah. One<br/>
of you two is a liar. You (husband) have right on her (wife).&quot; The husband said, &quot;My money, O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You are not entitled to take back any money. If you have told the truth,<br/>
the Mahr that you paid, was for having sexual relations with her lawfully; and if you are a liar, then<br/>
you are less entitled to get it back.&quot;<br/>
Book 64: Supporting the Family<br/>
