<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 285:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Habiba:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Will you marry my sister, the daughter of Abu<br/>
Sufyan.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do you like that?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, for I am not your only wife, and the person<br/>
I like most to share the good with me, is my sister.&quot; He said, &quot;That is not lawful for me.&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! We have heard that you want to marry Durra, the daughter of Abu Salama.&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;You mean the daughter of Um Salama?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Even if she were not my step-daughter,<br/>
she is unlawful for me, for she is my foster niece. Thuwaiba suckled me and Abu Salama. So you<br/>
should not present to me your daughters and sisters.&quot;<br/>
Narrated &#039;Ursa:<br/>
Thuwaiba had been a slave girl whom Abu Lahab had emancipated.<br/>
