<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 404:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Tha&#039;laba Al-Khushani:<br/>
I came to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the<br/>
Scripture, and we take our meals in their utensils, and there is game in that land and I hunt with my<br/>
bow and with my trained hound and with my untrained hound.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;As for your saying<br/>
that you are in the land of people of the Scripture, you should not eat in their utensils unless you<br/>
find no alternative, in which case you must wash the utensils and then eat in them As for your saying<br/>
that you are in the land of game, if you hunt something with your bow, mention Allah&#039;s Name<br/>
(while hunting the game) and eat; and if you hunt something with your trained hound, mention Allah&#039;s<br/>
Name on sending and eat; and if you hunt something with your untrained hound and get it<br/>
alive, slaughter it and you can eat of it&quot;<br/>
