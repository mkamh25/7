<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 110:<br/><br/>
Narrated Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face<br/>
and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What sin have I committed?&#039; Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said. &quot;What is this cushion?&quot; I said, &quot;I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline<br/>
on it.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;The makers of these pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection,<br/>
and it will be said to them, &#039;Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).&#039; &quot; The<br/>
Prophet added, &quot;The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals).&quot;<br/>
