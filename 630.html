<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 630:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet) that she asked Allah&#039;s Apostle about plague, and Allah&#039;s Apostle informed<br/>
her saying, &quot;Plague was a punishment which Allah used to send on whom He wished, but Allah made<br/>
it a blessing for the believers. None (among the believers) remains patient in a land in which plague<br/>
has broken out and considers that nothing will befall him except what Allah has ordained for him,<br/>
but that Allah will grant him a reward similar to that of a martyr.&quot;<br/>
