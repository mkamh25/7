<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 660:<br/><br/>
Narrated Aisha:<br/>
Magic was worked on Allah&#039;s Apostle so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his<br/>
wives while he actually had not (Sufyan said: That is the hardest kind of magic as it has such an effect).<br/>
Then one day he said, &quot;O &#039;Aisha do you know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter<br/>
I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one of them sat near my head and the other sat<br/>
near my feet. The one near my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?&#039; The latter<br/>
replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has worked magic on him?&#039; The<br/>
other replied Labid bin Al-A&#039;sam, a man from Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a<br/>
hypocrite.&#039; The first one asked, What material did he use)?&#039; The other replied, &#039;A comb and the hair<br/>
stuck to it.&#039; The first one asked, &#039;Where (is that)?&#039; The other replied. &#039;In a skin of pollen of a male date<br/>
palm tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan&#039; &#039;&#039; So the Prophet went to that well and took out<br/>
those things and said &quot;That was the well which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like<br/>
the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of devils.&quot; The Prophet added,<br/>
&quot;Then that thing was taken out&#039; I said (to the Prophet ) &quot;Why do you not treat yourself with<br/>
Nashra?&quot; He said, &quot;Allah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people.&quot;<br/>
