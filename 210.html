<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 210:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
The pagans were of two kinds as regards their relationship to the Prophet and the Believers. Some<br/>
of them were those with whom the Prophet was at war and used to fight against, and they used to<br/>
fight him; the others were those with whom the Prophet made a treaty, and neither did the Prophet<br/>
fight them, nor did they fight him. If a lady from the first group of pagans emigrated towards the<br/>
Muslims, her hand would not be asked in marriage unless she got the menses and then became<br/>
clean. When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to get married, and if her husband emigrated<br/>
too before she got married, then she would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave<br/>
emigrated from them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free persons (not slaves) and<br/>
they would have the same rights as given to other emigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the<br/>
pagans involved with the Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in Mujahid&#039;s narration. If a male<br/>
slave or a female slave emigrated from such pagans as had made a treaty with the Muslims, they<br/>
would not be returned, but their prices would be paid (to the pagans). Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas: Qariba,<br/>
the daughter of Abi Umaiyya, was the wife of &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#039;Umar divorced her and then<br/>
Mu&#039;awiyya bin Abi Sufyan married her. Similarly, Um Al-Hakam, the daughter of Abi Sufyan was the<br/>
wife of &#039;Iyad bin Ghanm Al-Fihri. He divorced her and then &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Uthman Al-Thaqafi married<br/>
her.<br/>
