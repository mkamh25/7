<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 184:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abi Ghallab Yunus bin Jubair:<br/>
I asked Ibn &#039;Umar,&quot;(What is said regarding) a man divorces his wife during her period?&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;Do you know Ibn &#039;Umar? Ibn &#039;Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. &#039;Umar then went<br/>
to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. The Prophet ordered him to take her back and when she<br/>
became clean, he could divorce her if he wanted.&quot; I asked (Ibn &#039;Umar), &quot;Was that divorce counted as<br/>
one legal divorce?&quot; He said, &quot;If one becomes helpless and foolish (will he be excused? Of course not).&quot;<br/>
