<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 198:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ikrima:<br/>
The sister of &#039;Abdullah bin Ubai narrated (the above narration, 197) with the addition that the<br/>
Prophet said to Thabit&#039;s wife, &quot;Will you return his garden?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and returned it, and (then)<br/>
the Prophet ordered Thabit to divorce her. Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas: The wife of Thabit bin Qais came to<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I do not blame Thabit for any defects in his character or<br/>
his religion, but I cannot endure to live with him.&quot; On that Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Will you return his<br/>
garden to him?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
