<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 195:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir:<br/>
A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam came to the Prophet while he was in the mosque and said, &quot;I<br/>
have committed illegal sexual intercourse.&quot; The Prophet turned his face to the other side. The man<br/>
turned towards the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and gave four witnesses<br/>
against himself. On that the Prophet called him and said, &quot;Are you insane?&quot; (He added), &quot;Are you<br/>
married?&quot; The man said, &#039;Yes.&quot; On that the Prophet ordered him to be stoned to the death in the Musalla<br/>
(a praying place). When the stones hit him with their sharp edges and he fled, but he was caught<br/>
at Al-Harra and then killed<br/>
