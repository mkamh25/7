<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 807:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sa&#039;d:<br/>
A man peeped into the house of the Prophet through a hole while the Prophet was scratching his<br/>
head with a Midrai (a certain kind of comb). On that the Prophet said (to him), &quot;If I had known you<br/>
had been looking, then I would have pierced your eye with that instrument, because the asking of<br/>
permission has been ordained so that one would not see things unlawfully.&quot;<br/>
