<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 516:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
I saw Allah&#039;s Apostle drinking milk. He came to my house and I milked a sheep and then mixed the<br/>
milk with water from the well for Allah&#039;s Apostle. He took the bowl and drank while on his left there<br/>
was sitting Abu Bakr, and on his right there was a bedouin. He then gave the remaining milk to the<br/>
bedouin and said, &quot;The right! The right (first).&quot;<br/>
