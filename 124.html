<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 124:<br/><br/>
Narrated Usama:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;I stood at the gate of Paradise and saw that the majority of the people who<br/>
entered it were the poor, while the wealthy were stopped at the gate (for the accounts). But the companions<br/>
of the Fire were ordered to be taken to the Fire. Then I stood at the gate of the Fire and saw<br/>
that the majority of those who entered it were women.&quot;<br/>
