<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 482:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
On the night Allah&#039;s Apostle was taken on a night journey (Miraj) two cups, one containing wine<br/>
and the other milk, were presented to him at Jerusalem. He looked at it and took the cup of milk.<br/>
Gabriel said, &quot;Praise be to Allah Who guided you to Al-Fitra (the right path); if you had taken (the<br/>
cup of) wine, your nation would have gone astray.&quot;<br/>
