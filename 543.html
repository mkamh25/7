<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 543:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
I was with the Prophet and the time for the &#039;Asr prayer became due. We had no water with us except<br/>
a little which was put in a vessel and was brought to the Prophet . He put his hand into it and<br/>
spread out his fingers and then said, &quot;Come along! Hurry up! All those who want to perform ablution.<br/>
The blessing is from Allah.&#039;&#039; I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed<br/>
the ablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and capacity),<br/>
for I knew that it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir, &quot;How many persons were<br/>
you then?&quot; He replied, &quot;We were one-thousand four hundred men.&quot; Salim said: Jabir said, 1500.<br/>
Book 70: Patients<br/>
