<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 352:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu &#039;Uthman:<br/>
I was a guest of Abu Huraira for seven days. Abu Huraira, his wife and his slave used to get up and<br/>
remain awake for one-third of the night by turns. Each would offer the night prayer and then<br/>
awaken the other. I heard Abu Huraira saying, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle distributed dates among his companions<br/>
and my share was seven dates, one of which was a Hashafa (a date which dried on the tree before<br/>
it was fully ripe).<br/>
