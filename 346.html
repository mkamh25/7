<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 346:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
I was a young boy when I once was walking with Allah&#039;s Apostle . Allah&#039;s Apostle entered the<br/>
house of his slave tailor and the latter brought a dish filled with food covered with pieces of gourd.<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle started picking and eating the gourd. When I saw that, I started collecting and placing<br/>
the gourd before him. Then the slave returned to his work. Anas added: I have kept on loving<br/>
gourd since I saw Allah&#039;s Apostle doing what he was doing.<br/>
