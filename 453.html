<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 453:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Bara:<br/>
The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &quot;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer<br/>
the (&#039;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to<br/>
our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered<br/>
was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&quot; (On<br/>
hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and<br/>
said, &quot;I have got a six month old ram.&quot; The Prophet said, &#039;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be<br/>
sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#039; added: The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever<br/>
slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition<br/>
of the Muslims.&quot;<br/>
