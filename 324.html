<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 324:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Hazim:<br/>
I asked Sahl bin Sad, &quot;Did Allah&#039;s Apostle ever eat white flour?&quot; Sahl said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle never<br/>
saw white flour since Allah sent him as an Apostle till He took him unto Him.&quot; I asked, &quot;Did the<br/>
people have (use) sieves during the lifetime of Allah&#039;s Apostle?&quot; Sahl said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle never saw<br/>
(used) a sieve since Allah sent him as an Apostle until He took him unto Him,&quot; I said, &quot;How could you<br/>
eat barley unsifted?&quot; he said, &quot;We used to grind it and then blow off its husk, and after the husk flew<br/>
away, we used to prepare the dough (bake) and eat it.&quot;<br/>
