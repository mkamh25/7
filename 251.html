<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 251:<br/><br/>
Narrated Humaid bin Nafi&#039;:<br/>
Zainab bint Abu Salama told me these three narrations: Zainab said: I went to Um Habiba, the wife<br/>
of the Prophet when her father, Abu- Sufyan bin Herb had died. Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume<br/>
which contained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls<br/>
with it and then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, &quot;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I<br/>
have heard Allah&#039;s Apostle saying, &#039;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day<br/>
to mourn for a dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should<br/>
mourn for four months and ten days.&#039; &quot; Zainab further said: I want to Zainab bint Jahsh when her<br/>
brother died. She asked for perfume and used some of it and said, &quot;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume,<br/>
but I have heard Allah&#039;s Apostle saying on the pulpit, &#039;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in<br/>
Allah and the last day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom she<br/>
should mourn for four months and ten days.&#039; &quot; Zainab further said, &quot;I heard my mother, Um Salama<br/>
saying that a woman came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! The husband of my daughter<br/>
has died and she is suffering from an eye disease, can she apply kohl to her eye?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
replied, &quot;No,&quot; twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, &quot;No.&quot; Then Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle added, &quot;It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance<br/>
a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed.&quot; I said to Zainab,<br/>
&quot;What does &#039;throwing a globe of dung when one year had elapsed&#039; mean?&quot; Zainab said, &quot;When a lady<br/>
was bereaved of her husband, she would live in a wretched small room and put on the worst clothes<br/>
she had and would not touch any scent till one year had elapsed. Then she would bring an animal,<br/>
e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her body against it. The animal against which she would rub<br/>
her body would scarcely survive. Only then she would come out of her room, whereupon she would<br/>
be given a globe of dung which she would throw away and then she would use the scent she liked or<br/>
the like.&quot;<br/>
