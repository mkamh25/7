<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 672:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Tha&#039;laba Al-Khushani:<br/>
The Prophet forbade the eating of wild animals having fangs. (Az-Zuhri said: I did not hear this<br/>
narration except when I went to Sham.) Al-Laith said: Narrated Yunus: I asked Ibn Shihab, &quot;May we<br/>
perform the ablution with the milk of she-asses or drink it, or drink the bile of wild animals or urine<br/>
of camels?&quot; He replied, &quot;The Muslims used to treat themselves with that and did not see any harm in<br/>
it. As for the milk of she-asses, we have learnt that Allah&#039;s Apostle forbade the eating of their meat,<br/>
but we have not received any information whether drinking of their milk is allowed or forbidden.&quot;<br/>
As for the bile of wild animals, Ibn Shihab said, &quot;Abu Idris Al-Khaulani told me that Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
forbade the eating of the flesh of every wild beast having fangs . &quot;<br/>
