<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 767:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
that when Abu Bakr became the Caliph, he wrote a letter to him (and stamped it with the Prophet&#039;s<br/>
ring) and the engraving of the ring was in three lines: Muhammad in one line, &#039;Apostle&#039; in another<br/>
line, and &#039;Allah&#039; in a third line. Anas added: &#039;the ring of the Prophet was in his hand, and after him, in<br/>
Abu Bakr&#039;s hand, and then in &#039;Umar&#039;s hand after Abu Bakr. When Uthman was the Caliph, once he<br/>
was sitting at the well of Aris. He removed the ring from his hand and while he was trifling with it,<br/>
dropped into the well. We kept on going to the well with Uthman for three days looking for the ring,<br/>
and finally the well was drained, but the ring was not found.<br/>
