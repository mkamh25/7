<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 570:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:<br/>
&#039;Aisha, (complaining of headache) said, &quot;Oh, my head&quot;! Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;I wish that had<br/>
happened while I was still living, for then I would ask Allah&#039;s Forgiveness for you and invoke Allah<br/>
for you.&quot; Aisha said, &quot;Wa thuklayah! By Allah, I think you want me to die; and If this should happen,<br/>
you would spend the last part of the day sleeping with one of your wives!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Nay, I<br/>
should say, &#039;Oh my head!&#039; I felt like sending for Abu Bakr and his son, and appoint him as my successor<br/>
lest some people claimed something or some others wished something, but then I said (to myself),<br/>
&#039;Allah would not allow it to be otherwise, and the Muslims would prevent it to be otherwise&quot;.<br/>
