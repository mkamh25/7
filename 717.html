<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 717:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Dharr:<br/>
I came to the Prophet while he was wearing white clothes and sleeping. Then I went back to him<br/>
again after he had got up from his sleep. He said, &quot;Nobody says: &#039;None has the right to be worshipped<br/>
but Allah&#039; and then later on he dies while believing in that, except that he will enter Paradise.&#039; I said,<br/>
&quot;Even It he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft.&quot; I said. &quot;Even if he had committed illegal<br/>
sexual intercourse and theft? He said. &#039;Even If he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and<br/>
theft,&quot; I said, &#039;Even it he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and thefts.&#039; He said, &quot;Even If he had<br/>
committed Illegal sexual intercourse and theft, inspite of the Abu Dharrs dislikeness. Abu &#039;Abdullah<br/>
said, &quot;This is at the time of death or before it if one repents and regrets and says &quot;None has the right<br/>
to be worshipped but Allah. He will be forgiven his sins.&quot;<br/>
