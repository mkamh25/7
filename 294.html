<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 294:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr:<br/>
We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet said, &quot;Have anyone of<br/>
you any food with him?&quot; It happened that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was<br/>
turned into dough then. After a while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet<br/>
asked, &#039;Will you sell us (a sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?&quot; The pagan said, &quot;No, but I will sell it &quot; So<br/>
the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet ordered that the<br/>
liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By Allah, none of those one hundred<br/>
and thirty men but had his share of those things. The Prophet gave to those who were present, and<br/>
also kept a share for those who were absent He then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and<br/>
we all ate together our fill; yet there remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the<br/>
camel.<br/>
