<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 249:<br/><br/>
Narrated Nafi:<br/>
Ibn &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab divorced his wife during her menses. Allah&#039;s Apostle ordered him to take<br/>
her back till she became clean, and when she got another period while she was with him, she should<br/>
wait till she became clean again and only then, if he wanted to divorce her, he could do so before<br/>
having sexual relations with her. And that is the period Allah has fixed for divorcing women.<br/>
Whenever &#039;Abdullah (bin &#039;Umar) was asked about that, he would say to the questioner, &quot;If you divorced<br/>
her thrice, she is no longer lawful for you unless she marries another man (and the other<br/>
man divorces her in his turn).&#039; Ibn &#039;Umar further said, &#039;Would that you (people) only give one or two<br/>
divorces, because the Prophet has ordered me so.&quot;<br/>
