<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 228:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#039;idi:<br/>
&#039;Uwaimir Al-Ajlani came to &#039;Asim bin Ad Al-Ansari and said to him, &quot;O &#039;Asim! Suppose a man saw<br/>
another man with his wife, would he kill him whereupon you would kill him; or what should he do?<br/>
Please, O &#039;Asim, ask about this on my behalf.&quot; &#039;Asim asked Allah&#039;s Apostle about it. Allah&#039;s Apostle, disliked<br/>
that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#039;Asim heard from Allah&#039;s Apostle was hard on<br/>
him. When &#039;Asim returned to his family, &#039;Uwaimir came to him and said, &quot;O &#039;Asim! What did Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle. say to you?&quot; &#039;Asim said to &#039;Uwaimir, &quot;You never bring me any good. Allah&#039;s Apostle disliked<br/>
the problem which I asked him about.&quot; &#039;Uwaimir said, &quot;By Allah, I will not give up this matter until I<br/>
ask the Prophet about it.&quot; So &#039;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#039;s Apostle in the midst of<br/>
people, and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he kill him,<br/>
whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Allah has revealed some<br/>
decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her.&quot; So they carried out the process of Lian<br/>
while I was present among the people with Allah&#039;s Apostle. When they had finished their Lian,<br/>
&#039;Uwaimir said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife, then I have told a lie.&quot;<br/>
So he divorced her thrice before Allah&#039;s Apostle ordered him. (Ibn Shihab said: So divorce was the<br/>
tradition for all those who were involved in a case of Lian.)<br/>
