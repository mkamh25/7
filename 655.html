<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 655:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
Two ladies (had a fight) and one of them hit the other with a stone on the abdomen and caused<br/>
her to abort. The Prophet judged that the victim be given either a slave or a female slave (as bloodmoney).<br/>
Narrated Ibn Shihab: Said bin Al-Musayyab said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle judged that in case of child<br/>
killed in the womb of its mother, the offender should give the mother a slave or a female slave in recompense<br/>
The offender said, How can I be fined for killing one who neither ate nor drank, neither<br/>
spoke nor cried: a case like that should be denied &#039; On that Allah&#039;s Apostle said &#039;He is one of the<br/>
brothers of the foretellers<br/>
