<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 701:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Hazim:<br/>
Shahl bin Sad said, &quot;A lady came with a Burda. Sahl then asked (the people), &quot;Do you know what<br/>
Burda is?&quot; Somebody said, &quot;Yes. it is a Shamla with a woven border.&quot; Sahl added, &quot;The lady said, &#039;O<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle! I have knitted this (Burda) with my own hands for you to wear it.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
took it and he was in need of it. Allah&#039;s Apostle came out to us and he was wearing it as an Izar. A<br/>
man from the people felt it and said, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Give it to me to wear.&#039; The Prophet s said,<br/>
&#039;Yes.&#039; Then he sat there for some time (and when he went to his house), he folded it and sent it to him.<br/>
The people said to that man, &#039;You have not done a right thing. You asked him for it, though you<br/>
know that he does not put down anybody&#039;s request.&#039; The man said, &#039;By Allah! I have only asked him<br/>
so that it may be my shroud when I die.&quot; Sahl added, &quot;Late it was his shroud.&quot;<br/>
