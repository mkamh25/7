<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 559:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu &#039;Uthman:<br/>
Usama bin Zaid said that while he. Sad and Ubai bin Ka&#039;b were with the Prophet a daughter of the<br/>
Prophet sent a message to him, saying. &#039;My daughter is dying; please come to us.&quot; The Prophet sent<br/>
her his greetings and added &quot;It is for Allah what He takes, and what He gives; and everything before<br/>
His sight has a limited period. So she should hope for Allah&#039;s reward and remain patient.&quot; She again<br/>
sent a message, beseeching him by Allah, to come. So the Prophet got up. and so did we (and went<br/>
there). The child was placed on his lap while his breath was irregular. Tears flowed from the eyes of<br/>
the Prophet. Sad said to him, &quot;What is this, O Allah&#039;s Apostle?&quot; He said. &quot;This Is Mercy which Allah<br/>
has embedded in the hearts of whomever He wished of His slaves. And Allah does not bestow His<br/>
Mercy, except on the merciful among His slaves. (See Hadith No. 373 Vol. 2)<br/>
