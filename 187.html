<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 187:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
A man divorced his wife thrice (by expressing his decision to divorce her thrice), then she married<br/>
another man who also divorced her. The Prophet was asked if she could legally marry the first husband<br/>
(or not). The Prophet replied, &quot;No, she cannot marry the first husband unless the second husband<br/>
consummates his marriage with her, just as the first husband had done.&quot;<br/>
