<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 35:<br/><br/>
Narrated Aisha&quot;<br/>
(regarding) the Verse: &#039;And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...&#039;<br/>
(4.3) It is about the orphan girl who is in the custody of a man who is her guardian, and he intends<br/>
to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly<br/>
and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her, two or three or four.<br/>
&#039;Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: ...your foster-mothers (who suckled you).&#039; (4.23) Marriage is<br/>
prohibited between persons having a foster suckling relationship corresponding to a blood relationship<br/>
which renders marriage unlawful.<br/>
