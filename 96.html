<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 96:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
When &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin &#039;Auf married an Ansari woman, the Prophet asked him, &quot;How much<br/>
Mahr did you give her?&quot; &#039;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;Gold equal to the weight of a date stone.&quot; Anas added:<br/>
When they (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) arrived at Medina, the emigrants stayed at the Ansar&#039;s<br/>
houses. &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin &#039;Auf stayed at Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#039;s house. Sad said to &#039;Abdur-Rahman,<br/>
&quot;I will divide and share my property with you and will give one of my two wives to you.&quot; &#039;Abdur-<br/>
Rahman said, &quot;May Allah bless you, your wives and property (I am not in need of that; but kindly<br/>
show me the way to the market).&quot; So &#039;Abdur-Rahman went to the market and traded there gaining a<br/>
profit of some dried yoghurt and butter, and married (an Ansari woman). The Prophet said to him,<br/>
&quot;Give a banquet, even if with one sheep.&quot;<br/>
