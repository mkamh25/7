<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 524:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle was offered something to drink. He drank of it while on his right was a boy and on<br/>
his left were some elderly people. He said to the boy, &quot;May I give these (elderly) people first?&quot; The boy<br/>
said, &quot;By Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I will not give up my share from you to somebody else.&quot; On that Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle placed the cup in the hand of that boy.<br/>
