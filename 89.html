<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 89:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
The Prophet stayed for three days at a place between Khaibar and Medina, and there he consummated<br/>
his marriage with Safiyya bint Huyay. I invited the Muslims to a banquet which included<br/>
neither meat nor bread. The Prophet ordered for the leather dining sheets to be spread, and then<br/>
dates, dried yogurt and butter were provided over it, and that was the Walima (banquet) of the<br/>
Prophet. The Muslims asked whether Safiyya would be considered as his wife or as a slave girl of<br/>
what his right hands possessed. Then they said, &quot;If the Prophet screens her from the people, then she<br/>
Is the Prophet&#039;s wife but if he does not screen her, then she is a slave girl.&quot; So when the Prophet proceeded,<br/>
he made a place for her (on the camel) behind him and screened her from people.<br/>
