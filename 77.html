<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 77:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ar-Rabi&#039;:<br/>
(the daughter of Muawwidh bin Afra) After the consummation of my marriage, the Prophet came<br/>
and sat on my bed as far from me as you are sitting now, and our little girls started beating the tambourines<br/>
and reciting elegiac verses mourning my father who had been killed in the battle of Badr.<br/>
One of them said, &quot;Among us is a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow.&quot; On that the<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;Leave this (saying) and keep on saying the verses which you had been saying before.&quot;<br/>
