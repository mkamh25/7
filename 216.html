<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 216:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
Abul Qasim (the Prophet ) said, &quot;There is an hour (or a moment) of particular significance on Friday.<br/>
If it happens that a Muslim is offering a prayer and invoking Allah for some good at that very<br/>
moment, Allah will grant him his request.&quot; (The sub-narrator placed the top of his finger on the<br/>
palm of the other hand between the middle finger and the little one.)<br/>
Volume 7, Book 63, Number 216h:<br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
During the lifetime of Allah&#039;s Apostle a Jew attacked a girl and took some silver ornaments she was<br/>
wearing and crushed her head. Her relative brought her to the Prophet while she was in her last<br/>
breaths, and she was unable to speak. Allah&#039;s Apostle asked her, &quot;Who has hit you? So-and so?&quot;, mentioning<br/>
somebody other than her murderer. She moved her head, indicating denial. The Prophet<br/>
mentioned another person other than the murderer, and she again moved her head indicating denial.<br/>
Then he asked, &quot;Was it so-and-so?&quot;, mentioning the name of her killer. She nodded, agreeing.<br/>
Then Allah&#039;s Apostle; ordered that the head of that Jew be crushed between two stones.<br/>
