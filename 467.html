<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 467:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Bara&#039;:<br/>
I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of &#039;Id-Allah. a), &quot;The first thing<br/>
we will do on this day of ours is that we will offer the &#039;Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter<br/>
our sacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever<br/>
slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his<br/>
family, and that was not a sacrifice.&quot; Abu Burda got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I slaughtered the<br/>
sacrifice before the prayer and I have got a Jadha&#039;a which is better than an old sheep.&quot; The Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;Slaughter it to make up for that, but it will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&quot;<br/>
