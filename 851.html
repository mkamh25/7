<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 851:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik :<br/>
We were coming from Khaibar along with Allah&#039;s Apostle while l was riding behind Abu Talha<br/>
and he was proceeding. While one of the wives of Allah&#039;s Apostle was riding behind Allah&#039;s Apostle,<br/>
suddenly the foot of the camel Slipped and I said, &quot;The woman!&quot; and alighted (hurriedly). Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle said, &quot;She is your mother.&quot; Sol resaddled the she-camel and Allah&#039;s Apostle mounted it. When<br/>
he approached or saw Medina, he said, &quot;Ayibun, ta&#039;ibun, &#039;abidun, li-Rabbina hami-dun.&quot;<br/>
