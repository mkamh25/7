<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 599:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
that he was asked about the wages of the one who cups others. He said, &#039;Allah&#039;s Apostle was<br/>
cupped by Abd Taiba, to whom he gave two Sa of food and interceded for him with his masters who<br/>
consequently reduced what they used to charge him daily. Then the Prophet s said, &quot;The best medicines<br/>
you may treat yourselves with are cupping and sea incense.&#039; He added, &quot;You should not torture<br/>
your children by treating tonsillitis by pressing the tonsils or the palate with the finger, but use incense.&quot;<br/>
