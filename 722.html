<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 722:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn Abi Laila:<br/>
While Hudhaifa was at Al-Madain, he asked for water whereupon the chief of the village brought<br/>
him water in a silver cup. Hudhaifa threw it at him and said, &quot;I have thrown it only because I have<br/>
forbidden him to use it, but he does not stop using it. Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &#039;Gold, silver, silk and Dibaj<br/>
(a kind of silk) are for them (unbelievers) in this world and for you (Muslims) in the hereafter.&#039;<br/>
