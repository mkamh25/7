<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 576:<br/><br/>
Narrated Qais bin Abi Hazim:<br/>
We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had been branded (cauterized) at seven<br/>
places in his body. He said, &quot;Our companions who died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (this<br/>
world) without having their rewards reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we<br/>
have got (so much) wealth that we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings<br/>
Had the Prophet not forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.&#039; We visited him for<br/>
the second time while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for<br/>
whatever he spends except for something that he spends on building.&quot;<br/>
