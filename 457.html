<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &quot;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer,<br/>
should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&quot; A man got up and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! This is a<br/>
day on which meat is desired.&quot; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &quot;I have a six month old ram<br/>
which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&quot; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice,<br/>
but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet<br/>
then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep<br/>
and distributed them among themselves.<br/>
