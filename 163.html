<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 163:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
The Prophet was screening me with his Rida&#039; (garment covering the upper part of the body) while<br/>
I was looking at the Ethiopians who were playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued<br/>
watching) till I was satisfied. So you may deduce from this event how a little girl (who has not<br/>
reached the age of puberty) who is eager to enjoy amusement should be treated in this respect.<br/>
