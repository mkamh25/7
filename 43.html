<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 43:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Habiba:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you like that?&quot;<br/>
I said, &quot;Yes, for even now I am not your only wife; and the most beloved person to share the good<br/>
with me is my sister.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;But that is not lawful for me (i.e., to be married to two sisters<br/>
at a time.)&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! By Allah, we have heard that you want to marry Durra, the<br/>
daughter of Abu Salama.&quot; He said, &quot;You mean the daughter of Um Salama?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;By<br/>
Allah ! Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for she is my<br/>
foster niece, for Thuwaiba has suckled me and Abu Salama; so you should neither present your<br/>
daughters, nor your sisters to me.&quot;<br/>
