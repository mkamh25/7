<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 303:<br/><br/>
Narrated Khalid bin Al-Walid:<br/>
That he went with Allah&#039;s Apostle to the house of Maimuna, who was his and Ibn &#039;Abbas&#039; aunt. He<br/>
found with her a roasted mastigure which her sister Hufaida bint Al-Harith had brought from Najd.<br/>
Maimuna presented the mastigure before Allah&#039;s Apostle who rarely started eating any (unfamiliar)<br/>
food before it was described and named for him. (But that time) Allah&#039;s Apostle stretched his hand<br/>
towards the (meat of the) mastigure whereupon a lady from among those who were present, said,<br/>
&quot;You should inform Allah&#039;s Apostle of what you have presented to him. O Allah&#039;s Apostle! It is the<br/>
meat of a mastigure.&quot; (On learning that) Allah&#039;s Apostle withdrew his hand from the meat of the<br/>
mastigure. Khalid bin Al-Walid said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Is this unlawful to eat?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle<br/>
replied, &quot;No, but it is not found in the land of my people, so I do not like it.&quot; Khalid said, &quot;Then I<br/>
pulled the mastigure (meat) towards me and ate it while Allah&#039;s Apostle was looking at me.<br/>
