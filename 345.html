<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 345:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Mas&#039;ud Al-Ansari:<br/>
There was a man called Abu Shu&#039;aib, and he had a slave who was a butcher. He said (to his slave),<br/>
&quot;Prepare a meal to which I may invite Allah&#039;s Apostle along with four other men.&quot; So he invited Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle and four other men, but another man followed them whereupon the Prophet said, &quot;You<br/>
have invited me as one of five guests, but now another man has followed us. If you wish you can admit<br/>
him, and if you wish you can refuse him.&quot; On that the host said, &quot;But I admit him.&quot; Narrated<br/>
Muhammad bin Isma&#039;il: If guests are sitting at a dining table, they do not have the right to carry food<br/>
from other tables to theirs, but they can pass on food from their own table to each other; otherwise<br/>
they should leave it.<br/>
