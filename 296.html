<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 296:<br/><br/>
Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu&#039;man:<br/>
We went out with Allah&#039;s Apostle to Khaibar, and when we were at As-Sahba&#039;, (Yahya, a sub-narrator<br/>
said, &quot;As-Sahba&#039; is a place at a distance of one day&#039;s journey to Khaibar).&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle asked<br/>
the people to bring their food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed<br/>
and ate of it. Then the Prophet asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our<br/>
mouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again).<br/>
