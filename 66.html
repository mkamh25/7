Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
A woman came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;I present myself (to you) (for marriage). She stayed for<br/>
a long while, then a man said, &quot;If you are not in need of her then marry her to me.&quot; The Prophet said,<br/>
&quot;Have you got anything m order to pay her Mahr?&quot; He said, &quot;I have nothing with me except my Izar<br/>
(waist sheet).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;If you give her your Izar, you will have no Izar to wear, (so go) and<br/>
search for something. He said, &quot;I could not find anything.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Try (to find something),<br/>
even if it were an iron ring But he was not able to find (even that) The Prophet said (to him). &quot;Do you<br/>
memorize something of the Qur&#039;an?&quot; &quot;Yes. &#039; he said, &quot;such Sura and such Sura,&quot; naming those Suras<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;We have married her to you for what you know of the Quran (by heart).&quot;<br/>
