<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 280:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
My father died and left seven or nine girls and I married a matron. Allah&#039;s Apostle said to me, &quot;O<br/>
Jabir! Have you married?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;A virgin or a matron?&quot; I replied, &quot;A matron.&quot; he said,<br/>
&quot;Why not a virgin, so that you might play with her and she with you, and you might amuse her and<br/>
she amuse you.&quot; I said, &quot; &#039;Abdullah (my father) died and left girls, and I dislike to marry a girl like<br/>
them, so I married a lady (matron) so that she may look after them.&quot; On that he said, &quot;May Allah bless<br/>
you,&quot; or &quot;That is good.&quot;<br/>
