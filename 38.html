<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 38:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Habiba:<br/>
(daughter of Abu Sufyan) I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Marry my sister. the daughter of Abu Sufyan.&quot;<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Do you like that?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, for even now I am not your only wife and I like<br/>
that my sister should share the good with me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;But that is not lawful for me.&quot; I said,<br/>
We have heard that you want to marry the daughter of Abu Salama.&quot; He said, &quot;(You mean) the<br/>
daughter of Um Salama?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Even if she were not my step-daughter, she would be<br/>
unlawful for me to marry as she is my foster niece. I and Abu Salama were suckled by Thuwaiba. So<br/>
you should not present to me your daughters or your sisters (in marriage).&quot; Narrated &#039;Ursa;<br/>
Thuwaiba was the freed slave girl of Abu Lahb whom he had manumitted, and then she suckled the<br/>
Prophet. When Abu Lahb died, one of his relatives saw him in a dream in a very bad state and asked<br/>
him, &quot;What have you encountered?&quot; Abu Lahb said, &quot;I have not found any rest since I left you, except<br/>
that I have been given water to drink in this (the space between his thumb and other fingers) and<br/>
that is because of my manumitting Thuwaiba.&quot;<br/>
