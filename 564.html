<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 564:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin Mas&#039;ud:<br/>
I visited Allah&#039;s Apostle while he was suffering from a high fever. I touched him with my hand and<br/>
said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! You have a high fever.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Yes, I have as much fever as two<br/>
men of you have.&quot; I said, &quot;Is it because you will get a double reward?&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Yes, no<br/>
Muslim is afflicted with harm because of sickness or some other inconvenience, but that Allah will<br/>
remove his sins for him as a tree sheds its leaves.&quot;<br/>
