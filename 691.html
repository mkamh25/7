<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 691:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Mughira:<br/>
One night I was with the Prophet on a journey. He asked (me), &quot;Have you got water with you?&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;Yes&quot; So he got down from his she-camel and went away till he disappeared in the darkness<br/>
of the night. Then he came back and I poured water for him from the pot (for the ablution). He<br/>
washed his face and hands while he was wearing a woollen cloak (the sleeves of which were narrow),<br/>
so he could not take his arms out of it. So he took them out from underneath the cloak. Then he<br/>
washed his forearms and passed his wet hands over his head. Then I tried to take off his Khuffs, but<br/>
he said, &quot;Leave them, for I have performed ablution before putting them on.&quot; And so he passed his<br/>
wet hands over them<br/>
