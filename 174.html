<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 174:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
We were with the Prophet in Ghazwa, and when we returned and approached Medina, I wanted<br/>
to hurry while riding a slow camel. A rider overtook me and pricked my camel with a spear which<br/>
he had, whereupon my camel started running as fast as any other fast camel you may see. I looked<br/>
back, and behold, the rider was Allah&#039;s Apostle . I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I am newly married &quot; He<br/>
asked, &quot;Have you got married?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;A virgin or a matron?&quot; I replied, &quot;(Not a virgin)<br/>
but a matron&quot; He said, &quot;Why didn&#039;t you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and<br/>
she with you?&quot; When we reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet said, &quot;Wait<br/>
till you enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her<br/>
hair and that the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair.&quot;<br/>
