<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 182:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Usaid:<br/>
We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between<br/>
which we sat down. The Prophet said, &quot;Sit here,&quot; and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from<br/>
Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima<br/>
bint An-Nu&#039;man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her,<br/>
he said to her, &quot;Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift.&quot; She said, &quot;Can a princess give herself in<br/>
marriage to an ordinary man?&quot; The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become<br/>
tranquil. She said, &quot;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&quot; He said, &quot;You have sought refuge with One<br/>
Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, &quot;O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen<br/>
dresses to wear and let her go back to her family.&quot; Narrated Sahl and Abu Usaid: The Prophet married<br/>
Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It<br/>
seemed that she disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to<br/>
provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541).<br/>
