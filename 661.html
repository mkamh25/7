<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 661:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Magic was worked on Allah&#039;s Apostle so that he began to imagine that he had done something although<br/>
he had not. One day while he was with me, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period<br/>
and then said, &quot;O &#039;Aisha! Do you know that Allah has instructed me regarding the matter I asked Him<br/>
about?&quot; I asked, &quot;What is that, O Allah&#039;s Apostle?&quot; He said, &quot;Two men came to me; one of them sat<br/>
near my head and the other sat near my feet. One of them asked his companion, &#039;What is the disease<br/>
of this man?&#039; The other replied, &#039;He is under the effect of magic.&#039; The first one asked, &#039;Who has<br/>
worked magic on him?&quot; The other replied, &#039;Labid bin A&#039;sam, a Jew from the tribe of Bani Zuraiq.&#039; The<br/>
(first one asked), &#039;With what has it been done?&#039; The other replied, &#039;With a a comb and the hair stuck<br/>
to it and a skin of the pollen of a male datepalm tree.&#039; The first one asked, &#039;Where is it?&#039; The other<br/>
replied, &#039;In the well of Dharwan.&#039; Then the Prophet went along with some of his companions to that<br/>
well and looked at that and there were date palms near to it. Then he returned to me and said, &#039;By<br/>
Allah the water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its date-palms were like<br/>
the heads of devils&quot; I said, O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?&quot; He<br/>
said, &#039;No! As for me Allah has healed me and cured me and I was afraid that (by Showing that to the<br/>
people) I would spread evil among them when he ordered that the well be filled up with earth, and it<br/>
was filled up with earth &quot;<br/>
