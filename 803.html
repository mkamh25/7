<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 803:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ubaidullah bin Hafs:<br/>
that &#039;Umar bin Nafi&#039; told him that Nafi&#039;, Maula &#039;Abdullah had heard &#039;Umar saying, &quot;I heard Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle forbidding Al-Qaza&#039;.&quot; &#039;Ubaidullah added: I said, &quot;What is Al-Qaza&#039;?&quot; &#039;Ubaidullah pointed (towards<br/>
his head) to show us and added, &quot;Nafi&#039; said, &#039;It is when a boy has his head shaved leaving a tuft<br/>
of hair here and a tuft of hair there.&quot; Ubaidullah pointed towards his forehead and the sides of his<br/>
head. &#039;Ubaidullah was asked, &quot;Does this apply to both girls and boys?&quot; He said, &quot;I don&#039;t know, but Nafi&#039;<br/>
said, &#039;The boy.&#039;&quot; &#039;Ubaidullah added, &quot;I asked Nafi&#039; again, and he said, &#039;As for leaving hair on the<br/>
temples and the back part of the boy&#039;s head, there is no harm, but Al-Qaza&#039; is to leave a tuft of hair<br/>
on his forehead unshaved while there is no hair on the rest of his head, and also to leave hair on<br/>
either side of his head.&#039;&quot;<br/>
