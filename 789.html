<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 789:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Today I saw myself in a dream near the Ka&#039;ba. I saw a whitish brown man,<br/>
the handsomest of all brown men you might ever see. He had the most beautiful Limma (hair<br/>
hanging down to the earlobes) you might ever see. He had combed it and it was dripping water; and<br/>
he was performing the Tawaf around the Kaba leaning on two men or on the shoulders of two men. l<br/>
asked, &quot;Who is this?&quot; It was said. &quot;Messiah, the son of Mary.&quot; Suddenly I saw a curly-haired man,<br/>
blind in the right eye which looked like a protruding out grape. I asked, &quot;Who is this?&quot; It was said,<br/>
&quot;He is Masiah Ad-Dajjal.&quot;<br/>
