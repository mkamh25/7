<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 144:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
that during his fatal ailment, Allah&#039;s Apostle, used to ask his wives, &quot;Where shall I stay tomorrow?<br/>
Where shall I stay tomorrow?&quot; He was looking forward to Aisha&#039;s turn. So all his wives allowed him<br/>
to stay where he wished, and he stayed at &#039;Aisha&#039;s house till he died there. &#039;Aisha added: He died on<br/>
the day of my usual turn at my house. Allah took him unto Him while his head was between my<br/>
chest and my neck and his saliva was mixed with my saliva.<br/>
