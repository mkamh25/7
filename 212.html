<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 212:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle took an oath that he would abstain from his wives, and at that time his leg had<br/>
been sprained (dislocated). So he stayed in the Mashruba (an attic room) of his for 29 days. Then he<br/>
came down, and they (the people) said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! You took an oath to abstain from your<br/>
wives for one month.&quot; He said, &quot;The month is of twenty nine days.&quot;<br/>
