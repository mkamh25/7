<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 151:<br/><br/>
Narrated Asma&#039; bint Abu Bakr:<br/>
When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any slave or anything else except a<br/>
camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I used to feed his horse with fodder and drew<br/>
water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake<br/>
bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to<br/>
carry the date stones on my head from Zubair&#039;s land given to him by Allah&#039;s Apostle and this land<br/>
was two third Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date<br/>
stones on my head, I met Allah&#039;s Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then, (directing<br/>
his camel to kneel down) said, &quot;Ikh! Ikh!&quot; so as to make me ride behind him (on his camel). I<br/>
felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and his sense of Ghira, as he was one of<br/>
those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira. Allah&#039;s Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded.<br/>
I came to Az-Zubair and said, &quot;I met Allah&#039;s Apostle while I was carrying a load of date<br/>
stones on my head, and he had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I<br/>
might ride, but I felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On<br/>
that Az-Zubair said, &quot;By Allah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the Prophet in<br/>
such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him.&quot; (I continued serving in this way) till<br/>
Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, whereupon I felt as if he had set me free.<br/>
