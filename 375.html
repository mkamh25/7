<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 375:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
I know (about) the Hijab (the order of veiling of women) more than anybody else. Ubai bin Ka&#039;b<br/>
used to ask me about it. Allah&#039;s Apostle became the bridegroom of Zainab bint Jahsh whom he married<br/>
at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle remained sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had<br/>
left. Then Allah&#039;s Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of<br/>
&#039;Aisha&#039;s room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I<br/>
also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for<br/>
the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of &#039;Aisha&#039;s room, he returned<br/>
and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a<br/>
curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed.<br/>
