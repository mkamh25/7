<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and<br/>
she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;This is a<br/>
matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the<br/>
others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#039;ba.&quot; &#039;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef<br/>
was brought to me and I asked, &quot;What is this?&quot; They (the people) said, &quot;Allah&#039;s Apostle has<br/>
slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&quot;<br/>
