<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 41:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Uqba bin Al-Harith:<br/>
I married a woman and then a black lady came to us and said, &quot;I have suckled you both (you and<br/>
your wife).&quot; So I came to the Prophet and said, &quot;I married so-and-so and then a black lady came to us<br/>
and said to me, &#039;I have suckled both of you.&#039; But I think she is a liar.&quot; The Prophet turned his face<br/>
away from me and I moved to face his face, and said, &quot;She is a liar.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;How (can you<br/>
keep her as your wife) when that lady has said that she has suckled both of you? So abandon (i.e., divorce)<br/>
her (your wife).&quot;<br/>
