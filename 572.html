<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 572:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sad:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle came to visit me during my ailment which had been aggravated during Hajjat-al-<br/>
Wada&#039;. I said to him, &quot;You see how sick I am. I have much property but have no heir except my only<br/>
daughter May I give two thirds of my property in charity?&quot;! He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;Half of it?&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;No.&quot; I said &quot;One third?&quot; He said, &quot;One third is too much, for to leave your heirs rich is better than to<br/>
leave them poor, begging of others. Nothing you spend seeking Allah&#039;s pleasure but you shall get a<br/>
reward for it, even for what you put in the mouth of your wife.&quot;<br/>
