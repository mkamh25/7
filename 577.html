<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 70, Number 577:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
I heard Allah&#039;s Apostle saying, &quot;The good deeds of any person will not make him enter Paradise.&quot;<br/>
(i.e., None can enter Paradise through his good deeds.) They (the Prophet&#039;s companions) said, &#039;Not<br/>
even you, O Allah&#039;s Apostle?&#039; He said, &quot;Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on<br/>
me.&quot; So be moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and none<br/>
of you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds, and if he is an<br/>
evil doer, he may repent to Allah.&quot;<br/>
