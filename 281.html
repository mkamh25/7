<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 64, Number 281:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
A man came to the Prophet and said, &quot;I am ruined!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Why?&quot; He said, &quot;I had sexual<br/>
intercourse with my wife while fasting (in the month of Ramadan).&quot; The Prophet said to him, &quot;Manumit<br/>
a slave (as expiation).&quot; He replied, &quot;I cannot afford that.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Then fast for two successive<br/>
months.&quot; He said, &quot;I cannot.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Then feed sixty poor persons.&quot; He said, &quot;I have<br/>
nothing to do that.&quot; In the meantime a basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet . He said,<br/>
&quot;Where is the questioner.&quot; The man said, &quot;I am here.&quot; The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Give this (basket of<br/>
dates) in charity (as expiation).&quot; He said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! Shall I give it to poorer people than us?<br/>
By Him Who sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina&#039;s two mountains poorer<br/>
than us.&quot; The Prophet smiled till his pre-molar teeth became visible. He then said, &quot;Then take it.&quot;<br/>
