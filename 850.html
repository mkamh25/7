<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 850:<br/><br/>
Narrated Mu&#039;adh bin Jabal<br/>
While I was riding behind the Prophet and between me and him and between me and him there<br/>
was only the back of the saddle, he said, &quot;0 Mu&#039;adh!&quot; I replied, &quot;Labbaik, 0 Allah&#039;s Apostle, and<br/>
Sa&#039;daik!&quot; he said, &quot;Do you know what is Allah&#039;s right upon his slave?&quot; I said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle<br/>
know best&quot; He said &quot;Allah&#039;s right upon his slaves is that they should worship Him alone and not worship<br/>
anything else besides Him.&quot; Then he proceeded for a while and then said, &quot;O Muadh bin Jabal!&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&#039;s Apostle:, Sa&#039;daik!&#039; He said, &quot;Do you know what is the right of the slaves<br/>
upon Allah if they do that?&quot; I replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know best.&quot; He said, &quot;The right of the<br/>
slaves upon Allah is that He will not punish them (if they do that).&quot;<br/>
