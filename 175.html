<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 175:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Hazim:<br/>
The people differed about the type of treatment which had been given to Allah&#039;s Apostle on the day<br/>
(of the battle) of Uhud. So they asked Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#039;id who was the only surviving Companion<br/>
(of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied, &quot;Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima<br/>
was washing the blood off his face and &#039;Ali was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of datepalm<br/>
leaves was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound.&quot;<br/>
