<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 248:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Hasan:<br/>
The sister of Ma&#039;qil bin Yasar was married to a man and then that man divorced her and remained<br/>
away from her till her period of the &#039;Iddah expired. Then he demanded for her hand in marriage, but<br/>
Ma&#039;qil got angry out of pride and haughtiness and said, &quot;He kept away from her when he could still<br/>
retain her, and now he demands her hand again?&quot; So Ma&#039;qil disagreed to remarry her to him. Then<br/>
Allah revealed: &#039;When you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed<br/>
period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.&#039; (2.232) So the Prophet sent for<br/>
Ma&#039;qil and recited to him (Allah&#039;s order) and consequently Ma&#039;qil gave up his pride and haughtiness<br/>
and yielded to Allah&#039;s order.<br/>
