<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 69, Number 536:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn Abi Laila:<br/>
While Hudhaita was at Mada&#039;in, he asked for water. The chief of the village brought him a silver<br/>
vessel. Hudhaifa threw it away and said, &quot;I have thrown it away because I told him not to use it, but<br/>
he has not stopped using it. The Prophet forbade us to wear clothes of silk or Dibaj, and to drink in<br/>
gold or silver utensils, and said, &#039;These things are for them (unbelievers) in this world and for you<br/>
(Muslims) in the Hereafter.&#039; &quot;<br/>
