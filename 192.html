<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 192:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ubaid bin &#039;Umar:<br/>
I heard &#039;Aisha saying, &quot;The Prophet used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drink<br/>
honey at her house. So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us, she should say<br/>
him, &quot;I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?&#039; &quot; So<br/>
the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet said, &quot;Never mind, I have<br/>
taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore.&quot; So there<br/>
was revealed: &#039;O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . If<br/>
you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,&#039; (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. &#039;When<br/>
the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.&#039; (66.3) namely his saying: But I<br/>
have taken some honey.&quot;<br/>
