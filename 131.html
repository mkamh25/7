<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 131:<br/><br/>
Narrated Ibn &#039;Abbas:<br/>
One morning we saw the wives of the Prophet weeping, and everyone of them had her family<br/>
with her, I went to the mosque and found that it was crowded with people. Then &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab<br/>
came and went up to the Prophet who was in his upper room. He greeted him but nobody<br/>
answered. He greeted again, but nobody answered. Then the gatekeeper called him and he entered<br/>
upon the Prophet, and asked, &quot;Have you divorced your wives?&quot; The Prophet, said, &quot;No, but I have<br/>
taken an oath not to go to them for one month.&quot; So the Prophet stayed away (from his wives) for<br/>
twenty nine days and then entered upon them.<br/>
