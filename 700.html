<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 700:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Once I was walking with Allah&#039;s Apostle and he was wearing a Najram Burd with thick margin. A<br/>
bedouin followed him and pulled his Burd so violently that I noticed the side of the shoulder of Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle affected by the margin of the Burd because of that violent pull. The Bedouin said, &quot;O<br/>
Muhammad! Give me some of Allah&#039;s wealth which is with you.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle turned and looked at<br/>
him, and smiling, &#039;he ordered that he be given something.<br/>
