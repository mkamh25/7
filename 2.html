<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 2:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ursa:<br/>
that he asked &#039;Aisha about the Statement of Allah: &#039;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal<br/>
justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if<br/>
you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that<br/>
your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&#039; (4.3) &#039;Aisha said,<br/>
&quot;O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship<br/>
of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a<br/>
Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden<br/>
to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr, and they are<br/>
ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;<br/>
