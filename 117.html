<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 117:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted that they would not conceal anything<br/>
of the news of their husbands. The first one said, &quot;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel<br/>
which is kept on the top of a mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one<br/>
might put up with the trouble of fetching it.&quot; The second one said, &quot;I shall not relate my husband&#039;s<br/>
news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe him, I will mention all his<br/>
defects and bad traits.&quot; The third one said, &quot;My husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears<br/>
of that) he will divorce me, and if I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&quot; The<br/>
fourth one said, &quot;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot nor<br/>
cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&quot; The fifth one said, &quot;My husband,<br/>
when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a lion. He does not ask about<br/>
whatever is in the house.&quot; The sixth one said, &quot;If my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the<br/>
dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me)<br/>
covered in garments and does not stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get<br/>
along).&quot; The seventh one said, &quot;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are<br/>
present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&quot; The eighth one said, &quot;My<br/>
husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of good smelling grass).&quot; The<br/>
ninth one said, &quot;My husband is a tall generous man wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His<br/>
ashes are abundant and his house is near to the people who would easily consult him.&quot; The tenth one<br/>
said, &quot;My husband is Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He<br/>
is beyond and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home<br/>
(ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When the camels<br/>
hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going to be slaughtered for<br/>
the guests.&quot; The eleventh one said, &quot;My husband is Abu Zar and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I<br/>
say about him)? He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and<br/>
my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so<br/>
happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and<br/>
living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and<br/>
purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the<br/>
morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what may<br/>
one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her<br/>
house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the son of Abu Zar? His bed is as<br/>
narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months) satisfies his hunger. As for the<br/>
daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body<br/>
and that arouses the jealousy of her husband&#039;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar,<br/>
what may one say of the (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps<br/>
them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our<br/>
house.&quot; The eleventh lady added, &quot;One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out at the time when<br/>
the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards<br/>
playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I<br/>
married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me<br/>
many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, &#039;Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give<br/>
provision to your relatives.&quot; She added, &quot;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me<br/>
could not fill the smallest utensil of Abu Zar&#039;s.&quot; &#039;Aisha then said: Allah&#039;s Apostle said to me, &quot;I am to<br/>
you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.&quot;<br/>
