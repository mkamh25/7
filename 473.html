<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 473:<br/><br/>
Narrated Masruq:<br/>
that he came to &#039;Aisha and said to her, &quot;O Mother of the Believers! There is a man who sends a<br/>
Hadi to Ka&#039;ba and stays in his city and requests that his Hadi camel be garlanded while he remains in<br/>
a state of Ihram from that day till the people finish their Ihram (after completing all the ceremonies<br/>
of Hajj)&quot; (What do you say about it?) Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the<br/>
curtain. She said, &quot;I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah&#039;s Apostle and he used to send his<br/>
Hadi to Ka&#039;ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their<br/>
wives till the people returned (from the Hajj).&quot;<br/>
