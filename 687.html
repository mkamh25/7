<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 687:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:<br/>
The Prophet came to visit Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) after he had been put in his grave. The<br/>
Prophet ordered that &#039;Abdullah be taken out. He was taken out and was placed on the knees on the<br/>
knees of the Prophet, who blew his (blessed) breath on him and dressed the body with his own shirt.<br/>
And Allah knows better.<br/>
