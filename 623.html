<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 623:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Some people from the tribes of &#039;Ukl and &#039;Uraina came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and embraced Islam and<br/>
said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers,&quot; and they found<br/>
the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#039;s Apostle ordered that they be given some camels<br/>
and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So<br/>
they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their<br/>
conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the<br/>
Prophet he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet ordered that their<br/>
eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till<br/>
they died in that state.<br/>
