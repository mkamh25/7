<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 8:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;The rewards (of deeds) are according to the intention, and everybody will get<br/>
the reward for what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for Allah&#039;s and His Apostle&#039;s sake, his<br/>
emigration was for Allah and His Apostle; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits, or to marry a<br/>
woman, then his emigration was for the thing for what he emigrated for.&quot; (1)<br/>
