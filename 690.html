<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 690:<br/><br/>
Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#039;ba:<br/>
The Prophet went to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I met him with water and<br/>
he performed the ablution while he was wearing a Sham, cloak. He rinsed his mouth, put the water<br/>
in his nose and blew it out, washed his face and tried to take his hands out of his sleeves, but they<br/>
were too narrow, so he took out his hands from under his chest and washed them and then passed<br/>
his wet hands over his head and Khuffs (leather socks) .<br/>
