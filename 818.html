<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 818:<br/><br/>
Narrated Asma:<br/>
(the daughter of Abu&#039; Bakr) A woman came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and said, &quot;I married my daughter to<br/>
someone, but she became sick and all her hair fell out, and (because of that) her husband does not<br/>
like her. May I let her use false hair?&quot; On that the Prophet cursed such a lady as artificially lengthening<br/>
(her or someone else&#039;s) hair or got her hair lengthened artificially.<br/>
