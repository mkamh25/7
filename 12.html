<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 12:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sad bin Abi Waqqas:<br/>
The Prophet prevented &#039;Uthman bin Mazun from that (not marrying), and had he allowed him, we<br/>
would have got ourselves castrated.(1)<br/>
Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13o:<br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah&#039;s Apostle and we had nothing (no wives)<br/>
with us. So we said, &quot;Shall we get ourselves castrated?&quot; He forbade us that and then allowed us to<br/>
marry women with a temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- &#039;O you who believe ! Make not unlawful<br/>
the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.&#039; (5.87)<br/>
Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13h:<br/>
Narrated Abu Huraira:<br/>
I said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse<br/>
and I cannot afford to marry.&quot; He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again,<br/>
but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my<br/>
question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, &quot;O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried<br/>
after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated<br/>
or not.&quot;<br/>
