<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 71, Number 625:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Abbas:<br/>
&#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab departed for Sham and when he reached Sargh, the commanders of the<br/>
(Muslim) army, Abu &#039;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah and his companions met him and told him that an epidemic<br/>
had broken out in Sham. &#039;Umar said, &quot;Call for me the early emigrants.&quot; So &#039;Umar called them,<br/>
consulted them and informed them that an epidemic had broken out in Sham. Those people differed<br/>
in their opinions. Some of them said, &quot;We have come out for a purpose and we do not think that it is<br/>
proper to give it up,&quot; while others said (to &#039;Umar), &quot;You have along with you. other people and the<br/>
companions of Allah&#039;s Apostle so do not advise that we take them to this epidemic.&quot; &#039;Umar said to<br/>
them, &quot;Leave me now.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Call the Ansar for me.&quot; I called them and he consulted them and<br/>
they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they did. He then said to them, Leave me<br/>
now,&quot; and added, &quot;Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest<br/>
of Mecca.&quot; I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, &quot;We advise that you should return<br/>
with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.&quot; So &#039;Umar made an announcement,<br/>
&quot;I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.&quot; Abu &#039;Ubaida bin Al-<br/>
Jarrah said (to &#039;Umar), &quot;Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?&quot; &#039;Umar said, &quot;Would<br/>
that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu &#039;Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had<br/>
ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don&#039;t you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley<br/>
having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah<br/>
had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?&quot; At<br/>
that time &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin &#039;Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, &quot;I have<br/>
some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah&#039;s Apostle saying, &#039;If you hear about it (an outbreak of<br/>
plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not<br/>
run away from it.&#039; &quot; &#039;Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina.<br/>
