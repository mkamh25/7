<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 63, Number 252:<br/><br/>
Narrated Um Salama:<br/>
A woman was bereaved of her husband and her relatives worried about her eyes (which were diseased).<br/>
They came to Allah&#039;s Apostle, and asked him to allow them to treat her eyes with kohl, but he<br/>
said, &quot;She should not apply kohl to her eyes. (In the Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance) a widowed woman<br/>
among you would stay in the worst of her clothes (or the worst part of her house) and when a<br/>
year had elapsed, if a dog passed by her, she would throw a globe of dung, Nay, (she cannot use<br/>
kohl) till four months and ten days have elapsed.&quot;<br/>
Narrated Um Habiba: The Prophet said, &quot;It is not lawful for a Muslim woman who believes in Allah<br/>
and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days, except for her husband, for whom she<br/>
should mourn for four months and ten days.&quot;<br/>
