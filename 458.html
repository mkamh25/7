<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Bakra:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created<br/>
the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in<br/>
succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#039;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is<br/>
between Juma&#039;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#039;ban. The Prophet then asked, &quot;Which month is this?&quot; We said,<br/>
&quot;Allah and his Apostle know better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a<br/>
name other than its real name. He said, &quot;Isn&#039;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&quot; We said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said,<br/>
&quot;Which town is this?&quot; We said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we<br/>
thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &quot;isn&#039;t it the town (of<br/>
Mecca)?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;What day is today?&quot; We replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know<br/>
better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real<br/>
name. He said, &quot;Isn&#039;t it the day of Nahr?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He then said, &quot;Your blood, properties and<br/>
honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours.<br/>
You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me<br/>
by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message<br/>
to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better<br/>
than some of those who have heard it directly.&quot; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this<br/>
used to say: The Prophet then said, &quot;No doubt! Haven&#039;t I delivered (Allah&#039;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#039;t<br/>
I delivered Allah&#039;s message (to you)?&quot;<br/>
