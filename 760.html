<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 760:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl:<br/>
A woman came to the Prophet and said, &quot;I have come to present myself to you (for marriage).&quot; She<br/>
kept standing for a long period during which period the Prophet looked at her carefully. When she<br/>
stayed for a Long period, a man said to the Prophet &quot;If you are not in need of her, then marry her to<br/>
me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Have you got anything to give her (as Mahr)?&quot; The man said, &quot;No.&quot; The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;Go (to your house) and search for something.&quot; The man went and came back to say,<br/>
&quot;By Allah, I could not find anything.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go again and search for something, even if it<br/>
be an iron ring.&quot; He went again and came back saying, &quot;No, by Allah, I could not get even an iron<br/>
ring.&quot; The man had only an Izar and had no Rida&#039; (upper garment). He said, &quot;I will give her my Izar<br/>
as Mahr.&quot; On that the Prophet said, &quot;Your Izar? If she wears it, nothing of it will remain on you, and<br/>
if you wear it nothing of it will be on her&quot; The man went aside and sat down When the Prophet saw<br/>
him leaving (after a while), he called back and asked. &quot;How much Qur&#039;an do you know (by heart)?<br/>
He said, &#039;I know such and such Suras,&quot; naming some Suras. The Prophet said, &quot;I marry her to you for<br/>
the amount of Qur&#039;an you know (by heart).&quot;<br/>
