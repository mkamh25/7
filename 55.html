<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 55:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin &#039;Umar :<br/>
&#039;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &quot;When Hafsa bint &#039;Umar became a widow after the death of (her husband)<br/>
Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi who had been one of the companions of the Prophet, and he<br/>
died at Medina. I went to &#039;Uthman bin &#039;Affan and presented Hafsa (for marriage) to him. He said, &quot;I<br/>
will think it over.&#039; I waited for a few days, then he met me and said, &#039;It seems that it is not possible for<br/>
me to marry at present.&#039; &quot; &#039;Umar further said, &quot;I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him, &#039;If you<br/>
wish, I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you.&quot; Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not say anything to me in<br/>
reply. I became more angry with him than with &#039;Uthman. I waited for a few days and then Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him. Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said,<br/>
&#039;Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?&#039;<br/>
I said, &#039;Yes.&#039; Abu Bakr said, &#039;Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah&#039;s Apostle. And if Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle had refused her, I would have accepted her.&#039; &quot;<br/>
