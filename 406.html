<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 406:<br/><br/>
Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:<br/>
We were with the Prophet in Dhul-Hulaifa and there the people were struck with severe hunger.<br/>
Then we got camels and sheep as war booty (and slaughtered them). The Prophet was behind all the<br/>
people. The people hurried and fixed the cooking pots (for cooking) but the Prophet came there and<br/>
ordered that the cooking pots be turned upside down. Then he distributed the animals, regarding ten<br/>
sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels ran away and there were a few horses with the<br/>
people. They chased the camel but they got tired, whereupon a man shot it with an arrow whereby<br/>
Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &quot;Among these animals some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of<br/>
them runs away from you, treat it in this way.&quot; I said. &quot;We hope, or we are afraid that tomorrow we<br/>
will meet the enemy and we have no knives, shall we slaughter (our animals) with canes?&quot; The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;If the killing tool causes blood to gush out and if Allah&#039;s Name is mentioned, eat (of the<br/>
slaughterer animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I am telling you why: A tooth is a<br/>
bone, and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&quot;<br/>
