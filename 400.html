<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 67, Number 400:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Qatada:<br/>
I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet<br/>
and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my<br/>
horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people<br/>
were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions,<br/>
&quot;What is that?&quot; They said, &quot;We do not know.&quot; I said, &quot;It is an onager.&#039; They said, &quot;It is what<br/>
you have seen.&quot; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &quot;Hand to me my whip.&quot; They said, &quot;We will not<br/>
help you in that (in hunting the onager).&quot; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my<br/>
horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &quot;Come on, carry it!&quot; But they said, &quot;We<br/>
will not even touch it.&quot; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and<br/>
some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &quot;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&quot; When I<br/>
met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &quot;Has anything of it been left with you?&quot; I<br/>
said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&quot;<br/>
