<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 34:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha :<br/>
Three principles were established because of Barira: (i) When Banra was manumitted she was given<br/>
the option (to remain with her slave husband or not). (ii) Allah&#039;s Apostle said &quot;The Wala of the<br/>
slave) is for the one who manumits (the slave). (iii) When Allah&#039;s Apostle entered (the house), he saw<br/>
a cooking pot on the fire but he was given bread and meat soup from the soup of the home. The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;Didn&#039;t I see the cooking pot (on the fire)?&quot; It was said, &quot;That is the meat given in charity<br/>
to Barira, and you do not eat the (things given in) charity.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;It is an object of charity<br/>
for Barira, and it is a present for us.&quot;<br/>
