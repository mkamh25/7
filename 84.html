<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 84:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
The Prophet offered a wedding banquet on the occasion of his marriage to Zainab, and provided a<br/>
good meal for the Muslims. Then he went out as was his custom on marrying, he came to the dwelling<br/>
places of the mothers of the Believers (i.e. his wives) invoking good (on them), and they were invoking<br/>
good (on him). Then he departed (and came back) and saw two men (still sitting there). So he<br/>
left again. I do not remember whether I informed him or he was informed (by somebody else) of<br/>
their departure).&quot;<br/>
