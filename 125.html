<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 125:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdullah bin Abbas:<br/>
During the lifetime of Allah&#039;s Apostle, the sun eclipsed. Allah&#039;s Apostle offered the prayer of (the)<br/>
eclipse) and so did the people along with him. He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during<br/>
which Surat-al-Baqara could have been recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then<br/>
raised his head and stood for a long time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited<br/>
Qur&#039;an). Then he performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the<br/>
period of the first bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the<br/>
period of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of a<br/>
lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser duration than<br/>
the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than the first, and then he<br/>
again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer. By then the sun eclipse had<br/>
cleared. The Prophet then said, &quot;The sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah, and<br/>
they do not eclipse because of the death or birth of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember<br/>
Allah (offer the eclipse prayer).&quot; They (the people) said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! We saw you<br/>
stretching your hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward.&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck a bunch (of<br/>
grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this world exists. Then I saw the<br/>
(Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible sight as that, and I saw that the majority of<br/>
its dwellers were women.&quot; The people asked, &quot;O Allah&#039;s Apostle! What is the reason for that?&quot; He<br/>
replied, &quot;Because of their ungratefulness.&quot; It was said. &quot;Do they disbelieve in Allah (are they ungrateful<br/>
to Allah)?&quot; He replied, &quot;They are not thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors<br/>
done to them. Even if you do good to one of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from<br/>
you, she will say, &quot;I have never seen any good from you.&#039; &quot;<br/>
