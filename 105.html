<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 105:<br/><br/>
Narrated Sahl bin Sad:<br/>
Abu Usaid As-Sa&#039;di invited Allah&#039;s Apostle to his wedding party and his wife who was the bride,<br/>
served them on that day. Do you know what drink she gave Allah&#039;s Apostle? She had soaked some<br/>
dates for him (in water) overnight, and when he had finished his meal she gave him that drink (of<br/>
soaked dates).<br/>
