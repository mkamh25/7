<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 56:<br/><br/>
Narrated Zainab bint Salama:<br/>
Um Habiba said to Allah&#039;s Apostle &quot;We have heard that you want to marry Durra bint Abu-<br/>
Salama.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle said, &quot;Can she be married along with Um Salama (her mother)? Even if I<br/>
have not married Um Salama, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster<br/>
brother.&quot; &#039;And there is no blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Allah<br/>
is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.&#039; (2.235) Ibn &#039;Abbas said, &quot;Hint your intention of marrying&#039; is<br/>
made by saying (to the widow) for example: &quot;I want to marry, and I wish that Allah will make a<br/>
righteous lady available for me.&#039; &quot; Al-Qasim said: One may say to the widow: &#039;I hold all respect for<br/>
you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring you much good, or something similar &#039;Ata said: One<br/>
should hint his intention, and should not declare it openly. One may say: &#039;I have some need. Have<br/>
good tidings. Praise be to Allah; you are fit to remarry.&#039; She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening<br/>
to what you say,&#039; but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise<br/>
(to somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the Iddat period,<br/>
she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they are not to be separated<br/>
by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid).<br/>
