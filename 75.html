<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 75:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:<br/>
&quot;When Hafsa became a widow,&quot; Umar said, &quot;I met Abu Bakr and said to him, &#039;If you wish I will<br/>
marry Hafsa bint &#039;Umar to you.&#039; I waited for a few days then Allah&#039;s Apostle asked for her hand. Later<br/>
Abu Bakr met me and said, &#039;Nothing stopped me from returning to you concerning your offer except<br/>
that I knew that Allah&#039;s Apostle had mentioned (his wish to marry) her, and I could never let out the<br/>
secret of Allah&#039;s Apostle . If he had left her, I would have accepted her.&#039; &quot;<br/>
