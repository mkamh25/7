<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 468:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas:<br/>
The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the &#039;Id prayer, should repeat it<br/>
(slaughter another one).&quot; A man said &quot;This is the day on which meat is desired.&quot; Then he mentioned<br/>
the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, &quot;I<br/>
have a Jadha&#039;a which is to me better than two sheep.&quot; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a<br/>
sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Proph-<br/>
et then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and<br/>
slaughtered them.<br/>
