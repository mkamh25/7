<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 176:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Abdur-Rahman bin &#039;Abis:<br/>
I heard Ibn &#039;Abbas answering a man who asked him, &quot;Did you attend the prayer of &#039;Id al Adha or<br/>
&#039;Id-al-Fitr with Allah&#039;s Apostle?&quot; Ibn &#039;Abbas replied, &quot;Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship<br/>
with him, I could not have offered it.&quot; (That was because of his young age). Ibn &#039;Abbas further<br/>
said, Allah&#039;s Apostle went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.&quot; Ibn &#039;Abbas<br/>
did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He added, &quot;Then the<br/>
Prophet went to the women and instructed them and gave them religious advice and ordered them<br/>
to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings<br/>
and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it) towards Bilal. Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his<br/>
house . &quot;<br/>
