<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 29:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Ursa:<br/>
that he asked &#039;Aisha regarding the Verse: &#039;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with<br/>
the orphans (4.3) She said, &quot;O my nephew! This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the<br/>
guardianship of her guardian who likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails<br/>
her Mahr. Such guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving<br/>
them their full Mahr, and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for<br/>
the verdict of Allah&#039;s Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: &#039;They ask your instruction concerning the<br/>
women . . . whom you desire to marry.&#039; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them that if the orphan girl had<br/>
beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her family status. They can only marry them if<br/>
they give them their full Mahr. And if they had no desire to marry them because of their lack of<br/>
wealth and beauty, they would leave them and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them,<br/>
when they had no interest, in them, they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest,<br/>
unless they treated them justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, &#039;If at all there is evil<br/>
omen, it is in the horse, the woman and the house.&quot; a lady is to be warded off. And the Statement of<br/>
Allah: &#039;Truly, among your wives and your children, there are enemies for you (i.e may stop you from<br/>
the obedience of Allah)&#039; (64.14)<br/>
