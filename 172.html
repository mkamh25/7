<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 172:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir:<br/>
I was with Allah&#039;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and when we returned, I wanted to hurry, while riding a<br/>
slow camel. A rider came behind me. I looked back and saw that the rider was Allah&#039;s Apostle . He<br/>
said (to me), &quot;What makes you in such a hurry?&quot; I replied, &quot;I am newly married.&quot; He said, &quot;Did you<br/>
marry a virgin or a matron?&quot; I replied, &quot;(Not a virgin but) a matron.&quot; He said, &quot;Why didn&#039;t you marry<br/>
a young girl with whom you could play and who could play with you?&quot; Then when we approached<br/>
(Medina) and were going to enter (it), the Prophet said, &quot;Wait till you enter (your homes) at night (in<br/>
the first part of the night) so that the ladies with unkempt hair may comb their hair, and those whose<br/>
husbands have been absent (for a long time) may shave their pubic hair.&quot; (The sub-narrator, Hashim<br/>
said: A reliable narrator told me that the Prophet added in this Hadith: &quot;(Seek to beget) children!<br/>
Children, O Jabir!&quot;)<br/>
