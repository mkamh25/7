<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 354:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah:<br/>
There was a Jew in Medina who used to lend me money up to the season of plucking dates. (Jabir<br/>
had a piece of land which was on the way to Ruma). That year the land was not promising, so the<br/>
payment of the debt was delayed one year. The Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered<br/>
nothing from my land. I asked him to give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the<br/>
Prophet whereupon he said to his companions, &quot;Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.&quot; All of<br/>
them came to me in my garden, and the Prophet started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew said, &quot;O Abu<br/>
Qasim! I will not grant him respite.&quot; When the Prophet saw the Jew&#039;s attitude, he stood up and<br/>
walked all around the garden and came again and talked to the Jew, but the Jew refused his request.<br/>
I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to<br/>
me, &quot;Where is your hut, O Jabir?&quot; I informed him, and he said, &quot;Spread out a bed for me in it.&quot; I<br/>
spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him again<br/>
and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again refused his request.<br/>
Then the Prophet got up for the second time amidst the palm trees loaded with fresh dates, and said,<br/>
&quot;O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.&quot; The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates,<br/>
till I paid him all his right, yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded<br/>
till I reached the Prophet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, &quot;I testify that I am<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle.&quot;<br/>
