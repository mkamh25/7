<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 466:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle entered upon me at Sarif while I was weeping (because I was afraid that I would<br/>
not be able to perform the ,Hajj). He said, &quot;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform<br/>
the ceremonies of the Hajj as the pilgrims do, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#039;ba.&quot; Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.<br/>
