<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 52:<br/><br/>
Narrated Jabir bin &#039;Abdullah and Salama bin Al-Akwa&#039;:<br/>
While we were in an army, Allah&#039;s Apostle came to us and said, &quot;You have been allowed to do the<br/>
Mut&#039;a (marriage), so do it.&quot; Salama bin Al-Akwa&#039; said: Allah&#039;s Apostle&#039;s said, &quot;If a man and a woman<br/>
agree (to marry temporarily), their marriage should last for three nights, and if they like to continue,<br/>
they can do so; and if they want to separate, they can do so.&quot; I do not know whether that was only for<br/>
us or for all the people in general. Abu Abdullah (Al-Bukhari) said: &#039;Ali made it clear that the Prophet<br/>
said, &quot;The Mut&#039;a marriage has been cancelled (made unlawful).&quot;<br/>
