<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 68, Number 475:<br/><br/>
Narrated Abu Sa&#039;id Al-Khudri:<br/>
that once he was not present (at the time of &#039;Id-al-Adha) and when he came. some meat was<br/>
presented to him. and the people said (to him), &#039;This is the meat of our sacrifices&quot; He said. &#039;Take it<br/>
away; I shall not taste it. (In his narration) Abu Sa&#039;id added: I got up and went to my brother, Abu<br/>
Qatada (who was his maternal brother and was one of the warriors of the battle of Badr) and mentioned<br/>
that to him He Sad. &#039;A new verdict was given in your absence (i.e., meat of sacrifices was allowed<br/>
to be stored and eaten later on).&quot;<br/>
