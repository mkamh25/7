<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 65, Number 313:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Urban bin Malik:<br/>
who attended the Badr battle and was from the Ansar, that he came to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle! I have lost my eyesight and I lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains,<br/>
the valley which is between me and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their<br/>
mosque to lead them in the prayer. O Allah&#039;s Apostle! I wish that you could come and pray in my<br/>
house so that I may take it as a praying place. The Prophet said, &quot;Allah willing, I will do that.&quot; The<br/>
next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah&#039;s Apostle came with Abu Bakr. The Prophet asked<br/>
for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet had not sat till he had entered the house<br/>
and said to me, &quot;Where do you like me to pray in your house?&quot; I pointed at a place in my house<br/>
whereupon he stood and said, &quot;Allahu Akbar.&quot; We lined behind him and he prayed two Rakat and<br/>
finished it with Taslim. We then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had<br/>
prepared. A large number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said,<br/>
&quot;Where is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&quot; Another man said, &quot;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah<br/>
and His Apostle.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do not say so. Do you not think that he has said: &quot;None has the<br/>
right to be worshipped but Allah,&quot; seeking Allah&#039;s pleasure? The man said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle<br/>
know better, but we have always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.&quot; The<br/>
Prophet said, &quot;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to be<br/>
worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah&#039;s pleasure. &quot;<br/>
