<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

VOLUME 7<br/>
Book 62: Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)<br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 1:<br/><br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped<br/>
(Allah), and when they were informed about that, they considered their worship insufficient<br/>
and said, &quot;Where are we from the Prophet as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&quot; Then one<br/>
of them said, &quot;I will offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&quot; The other said, &quot;I will fast<br/>
throughout the year and will not break my fast.&quot; The third said, &quot;I will keep away from the women<br/>
and will not marry forever.&quot; Allah&#039;s Apostle came to them and said, &quot;Are you the same people who<br/>
said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast<br/>
and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion,<br/>
is not from me (not one of my followers).&quot;<br/>
