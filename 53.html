<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 62, Number 53:<br/><br/>
Narrated Thabit Al-Banani:<br/>
I was with Anas while his daughter was present with him. Anas said, &quot;A woman came to Allah&#039;s<br/>
Apostle and presented herself to him, saying, &#039;O Allah&#039;s Apostle, have you any need for me (i.e. would<br/>
you like to marry me)?&#039; &quot;Thereupon Anas&#039;s daughter said, &quot;What a shameless lady she was ! Shame!<br/>
Shame!&quot; Anas said, &quot;She was better than you; she had a liking for the Prophet so she presented herself<br/>
for marriage to him.&quot;<br/>
