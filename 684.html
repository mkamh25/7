<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 72, Number 684:<br/><br/>
Narrated &#039;Aisha:<br/>
(the wife of the Prophet)<br/>
The wife of Rifa&#039;a Al-Qurazi came to Allah&#039;s Apostle while I was sitting, and Abu Bakr was also<br/>
there. She said, &#039;O Allah s Apostle! I was the wife of Rifa&#039;a and he divorced me irrevocably. Then I<br/>
married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair who, by Allah, O Allah&#039;s Apostle, has only something like a<br/>
fringe of a garment, Showing the fringe of her veil. Khalid bin Sa&#039;id, who was standing at the door,<br/>
for he had not been admitted, heard her statement and said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Why do you not stop this<br/>
lady from saying such things openly before Allah&#039;s Apostle?&quot; No, by Allah, Allah&#039;s Apostle did nothing<br/>
but smiled. Then he said to the lady, &quot;Perhaps you want to return to Rifa&#039;a? That is impossible unless<br/>
&#039;Abdur-Rahman consummates his marriage with you.&quot; That became the tradition after him.<br/>
