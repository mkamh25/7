<b>SAHIH BUKHARI</b><br/><br/>

Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:<br/><br/>
Narrated Asma&#039; bint Abu Bakr:<br/>
I conceived &#039;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give<br/>
birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#039;, and gave birth at Quba&#039;. Then I brought the child to<br/>
Allah&#039;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the<br/>
mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#039;s Apostle. Then he<br/>
did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic<br/>
era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the<br/>
Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.<br/>
Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:<br/>
Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br/>
Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu<br/>
Talha returned home, he asked, &quot;How does my son fare?&quot; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &quot;He is quieter<br/>
than he has ever been.&quot; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her.<br/>
When he had finished, she said (to him), &quot;Bury the child (as he&#039;s dead).&quot; Next morning Abu Talha<br/>
came to Allah&#039;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Did you sleep with your<br/>
wife last night?&quot; Abu Talha said, &quot;Yes&quot;. The Prophet said, &quot;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as<br/>
regards that night of theirs.&quot; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the<br/>
child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim<br/>
sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was<br/>
something with him. The people replied, &quot;Yes, a few dates.&quot; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took<br/>
some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#039;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and<br/>
named him &#039;Abdullah.<br/>
